0,1,"This is not a dystopia, it is a romance. This is not a novel, it is a collection of similes and metaphors, most of which do not make sense. I originally gave Shatter Me two stars because that's my sort of kneejerk reaction to books I don't like, but after thinking it over for a while, I can't recall anything positive about it that would justify a rating of more than one star.You're probably assuming - correctly - that I went into this book with low expectations. This is completely true. Any so-called ""dystopia"" with a runway model on the front cover leaves me feeling sceptical. However, I was also prepared to allow myself to be surprised; a lot of my friends loved this and one of the biggest criticisms didn't actually bother me - purple prose. I think there's a fine line in writing between the pretty and the purplish and different readers will define it in their own way. For example, some reviewers thought that Lips Touch: Three Times was just a mess of bloated purple prose, whereas I thought it was one of the most beautiful books I read last year. I have a high tolerance level for flowery writing. But...Shatter Me's numerous metaphors, similes, and endless descriptions just didn't make sense. What is this?:""Hate looks like everybody else until it smiles. Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into semblance of something too passive to punch.""I just... WHAT??? This is one example floating around in there, but every second sentence is like this! That's not even mentioning the annoying strike-outs. Trust me, no really, trust me, I thought people were being overly picky when they said the crossed out sentences were annoying. I actually thought it sounded interesting, unusual, especially because the whole thing is meant to be written in a notebook and I cross stuff out in mine all the time. But you have no idea how bloody annoying this is to read. All the effin' time. People didn't exaggerate: it will most likely drive you crazy.However, there was one thing that for me was even more annoying than the descriptions, the similes, the strikes, and that was the stupid repetition thing: ""and then and then and then..."" Again, if it had been used once, or sparingly even, then it wouldn't be so bad. I may have thought it was an interesting literary technique. But Shatter Me had way way way too much of everything (see what I did there?).And story? What story? *sigh* It's about time we just opened up an entirely new genre called ""Dystopian Romance"" or alternatively ""Romantic Dystopia"", though I don't wish to be pessimistic, I'm pretty sure half the new releases of 2012 will make it into that category. If there was a story then it drowned amidst the waves of overenthusiastic and flowery prose. This reminded me of Article 5 in that the dystopia was there to make the romance interesting. One was certainly there to complement the other, but it was the wrong way around.Also... kissing when you are fleeing for your lives?? I'm sure this is not the correct way of things, right? And yet it occurs in way too many young adult books. I'm like: ""run, run, run!"" but the characters are too busy swapping saliva. I must be old-fashioned in my thinking that staying alive is kinda important.There are a lot of things that, had they been there, could have convinced me to up this to two stars. One star ratings make me feel sucky. But I'm sorry guys, I wasn't even entertained. The beginning was intriguing but there was so little plot beyond the romance that it quickly became tedious. I hated the prose, I felt nothing either way for the characters, this series ends here for me."
1,1,"I know many found this book to have a very unique writing style, but I can't help but think how terrible and awkwardly written it was. The writing:Mafi's style of writing varies. Let me categorize.This doesn't even make sense writing:""I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage.""""He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter.""I'm picturing this in my head and it's not pretty writing:""Every organ in my body falls to the ground.""""There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.""""My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.""""My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.""""My stomach drops onto my knees.""""I blush through my bones.""""My spine is conducting enough electricity to power a city.""Repetition gone wrong writing:""I blush.""""I blush.""""His lips part. Close.""""I blush.""""I blush.""""His lips part. Close.""""I blush.""""I blush.""""His lips part. Close."" Really just shit writing in general writing:""I am an old creaky staircase when I wake up.""""Warner thinks Adam is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations."" Do I need to explain how shitty this writing is? And yes, before people yell at me and tell me that I don't understand metaphors... I do. But the excessive use of them and just metaphors themselves are maybe not my thing. The characters:Juliette does nothing but sulk around, wait for death, and whine. I saw no potential of her growing.Adam is just there...Warner is just... almost there? I must admit that a few times, he had potential to be a good character. I thought he was the only character that brought something. He made me cringe. He made me angry, made me feel uncomfortable. He was getting there. At least then I felt like he had some sort of purpose in this story. Then he would say something so cheesy, so inconsistent with his character, and just downright stupid that I lost all hope in him.Kenji was just fucking annoying. The plot:Besides Juliette's constant whining and lameness and the cringeworthy romances, this story was just a sadder and lamer version of X-Men. It had too many X-Men vibes going on. On the whole:Mafi, if you wanted to capture me with I'm just trying way too hard to sound cool unique prose, thinking that if you repeated phrases fifty times every once in a while, had painful metaphors, and an unnecessary abundance of irritating striking texts, then *reads acknowledgments*You've filled my days with shooting stars, and one day I will pluck the moon from the sky and put it in your mailbox.She speaks like that in real life...?"
2,0,"MY PRECIOUS IS NOW SIGNED BY TAHEREH!!! I can die of happiness now <3 In case y'all didn't know, not only was this book optioned by Warner Bros as a movie, it has now been optioned as a TV SHOW BY ABC STUDIOS -with Tahereh as a producer.This better happen. I am not joking. I am tired of great books (cough, cough: The Song of the Lioness Quartet and The Dust Lands Trilogy: Blood Red Road; Rebel Heart; Raging Star) not becoming movies or TV shows after they are optioned. Dear book gods (and I know you exist because you inspired Tahereh to write this series), make this real. Yes, I know TV/movies don't always make great adaptations and the books are 99.9% of the time better, but please do it anyway. Because I need this.Oh, and if you decide to cast Alex Pettyfer as Warner I would be cool with that.Original fan-girl praise (because I am incapable of actually writing a true unbiased, unaffected review for this series):Okay, I have not properly reviewed this series since I read it a year ago (and I don't think I ever can because it would be ridiculously long and the book is so quotable that I would literally be citing the entire thing) but Shatter Me is one of my favorite series of ALL TIME. And it has my FAVORITE LOVE INTEREST of ANY BOOK I'VE EVER READ. Butttt, to anyone considering it, watch this: http://youtu.be/dJt-lGmBSTs. I just found that fan video the other day and I can't stop watching it. I'm sorry but if that doesn't make you want to read this book you do not have a soul. READ. THIS. BOOK. You will either love it or hate it (depending on how you feel about prose) but if you love it than O.M.G. you will love it like you've loved nothing else.Oh, and for those of you who have already read the series: TeamWarner. TeamWarner. TeamOhMyGawdILoveHimWarner!!! PS this review basically is a dedication to Alex Pettyfer as Warner. YOU ARE WELCOME."
3,2,"Juliette describing Adam’s eyes“...perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided”“…careful, curious”“… 2 buckets of rainwater; deep, fresh, clear”“…blue and bottomless like the deepest part of the ocean”“…tight” “…as tight as his fists as tight as the strain in his arms”“…bottomless blue”“…blue blue blue”“…midnight moment filled with memories, the only windows into my world”“… always shining the darkness”“…two pools of perfection, open, honest, humble”“…a shade of blue in a midnight sky”Juliette describing Adam’s gaze“…like a white-hot poker pressed against my skin”“…touching every inch of my body”“…locked into mine”“… is fixed on me: calm, unflappable; 2 buckets of river water at midnight. I’d like to cry into his eyes”I’ve never been a purple prose type of girl. A book that will forever remain nameless spoke of “leaking wombs” and well it made me shiver. It also introduced me to the entire concept of purple prose. Prose can be beautiful. I’ve read plenty of books where the writing touches me deeply and the author is simply writing about the sunset, or a walk in the park, or the plight of the poor. If the author is able to actually tell a story without distracting the reader with the prose, I’m all for it. That is not the case with “Shatter Me”. “Shatter Me” was like my first attempt at cooking a turkey  over-done. It was  like climbing Mount Everest  tiring, watching kids play outside your window while you are taking a test  distracting, and my dog throwing his bone at me silly. At some point, I was drowning, desperately searching for land overwhelmed by the prose and eager for the story. And don’t get me started about the crossing out of passages in the book. It was irritating,  annoying stupid  a cheap trick  dumb, something I did not enjoy. Overall-I won’t read the next book.I might read the next book if I get a free copy.I’m curious to see where the author can go since it is clear that she can write. I think someone needed to  put a leash on the over playful puppy edit her prose down to a more controllable level so that people could enjoy the story rather than cringe with every every every  regurgitation  eruption  spewing  listen you need to stop crossing me off or I’m gonna sick some nasty virus on your ass incident of prose. "
4,1,"I deserve a medal for finishing this book.Like, the Olympic gold medal in the Anti-DNF Games, people. *Rant Ahead*It took me three months to finish this book.THREE. (Not 3, Miss Mafi)Now, normally, I would have tossed this book out the window like an overwrought Silver Linings Playbook Bradley Cooper, being that I AM the queen of the heartless page 15 DNF; however, I find that I have a harder time DNFing something when I am 1) Reading a physical copy as opposed to a digital copy, and 2) When I already OWN books two and three and am hoping to FUCK I didn't waste my money. That said, this book annoyed me on several different levels. 1) Juliette's ""power"" or ""glitch"" or whatever the hell it is, is never fully explained in detail. It's skirted around in a mass of overwrought metaphors and complete bullshit. 2) Said overwrought metaphors.3) The writing itself in general. Despite having a degree in English and Literature, I am usually pretty easygoing about typos and grammar, especially when it comes to self-published stuff. I mean just LOOK at the slang and vernacular I use in my reviews. I am NOT a hard ass about this stuff. HOWEVER.When I am holding a professionally published, FINISHED copy of a mass produced book and it contains strikeouts, sentences starting in lowercase letters, and numbers one through ten incorrectly placed in number form, e.g., ""Juliette has 2 hands and 0 1 brain,"" my inner grammar maven's granny panties get twisted so far up her ass, it's impossible to focus. I mean, I GET that this was all a stylistic choice, etc. That the sporadic, all over the place, SHITTY sentence structure was supposed to reflect Juliette's instability, or whatever the fuck it was supposed to reflect, but I just can't get behind starting a sentence with ""4,"" my friends. Add to that the insta-love between Juliette and Adam and the spindly world-building of a completely unclear and poorly wrought dystopian society and you have a wreck of a book that merely has a pretty cover. Now I am left with the crushing decision of whether or not I try book two (since I, like an idiot, already bought it) or if I just march the whole trilogy down to my favorite used book store and hope the fact that this series is about to have a new book published gets me top dollar. Decisions, decisions."
5,0,"4/5 stars.The only reason I gave this book 4 and not 5 stars is because I really dislike Adam and Juliette as a couple.Juliette “loved” Adam because he was the only one who was nice to her, the only one who noticed her when they were kids. It hasn't changed. He can touch her, and she- the girl who has never been touched, the girl whose whole life she wanted to feel loved- she “fell in love” with him.Now, I'm pretty sure she's confused between love and this new feeling she loves, the feeling that someone touches her and that someone loves her.She’s a poor girl after all, she never felt how a person cared about her, I can understand why she’s so sure she’s in love with Adam.Adam himself, well, let’s say I'm not so fond of him when he's with her. He’s insanely cringe in my opinion. The way he always wanted her, the way he looked for her everywhere. I’m sorry, It's too cliche, yuck.And Juliet? You may notice that she enjoys his touch more than him specifically. It's not love. Come on. Nope.But I really like Adam in general, he’s very sweet. And of course Juliette loves Adam in general, but... I don’t think their love is true. Idk, let’s see how it’ll work out.The plot itself was amazing. The idea is amazing. Kenji is amazing. Warner is amazing. Oh, Warner is SO AMAZING. He's a cute psychopath, it's the perfect combination. I love you Warner. Ooookaayyy, I'm ready for the second book."
6,1,"“I always wonder about raindrops.I wonder about how they're always falling down, tripping over their own feet, breaking their legs and forgetting their parachutes as they tumble right out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It's like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn't seem to care where the contents fall, doesn't seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors.I am a raindrop.My parents emptied their pockets of me and left me to evaporate on a concrete slab.” Here lies Steph Sinclair, slaughtered by metaphors raindrops."
7,5,"*reread for a special vid* —————————————-(Reread)finally writing a review for one of my favourite series of all time. Shatter me, especially the first book has in my opinion alot of death and emotions, mostly dark sad and depressed ones in this book but I think it is a great representation of what it would feel like to be locked up for so long without being able to touch another person. her reaction to the other person, Adam, is very realistic and the way Juliette is obsessed with numbers makes alot of sense. The enemy in this book is great and obviously the sarcastic best friend bring joy to this book. Cannot wait to have others experience the character development and overall growth that juliette goes through"
8,1,"Oh, Juliette, SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY. Insufferable whiny bitch."
9,1,this book is what i see in the corner of my room while having sleep paralysis
10,0,"""He's wrong he's so wrong he's more wrong than an upside-down rainbow.""ok. "
11,5,"I literally read 300 pgs in one sitting and finished the whole book in 24 hrs. Haven't done that with a book in a LONG time. That's how much I loved it. I love that we jump straight into the plot. That made it such a fast read.And THE WRITING STYLE. I know it's not going to be for everyone, but I loved the metaphors, crossed-out words, and repeated words/phrases. It really puts us in Juliette's head and shows us her mental state after being in solitary confinement for 260+ days. And I love how the writing style evolves as Juliette's confidence and state of mind evolve. So far, I loveeee Adam and how caring he is, and I'm so intrigued to see how Warner's character evolves (even tho I hate him right now). Shatter Me series reading vlog coming soon."
12,2,"Shat­ter Me, oth­er­wise known as: When Cre­ative Writ­ing Class Goes Wrong.I am all for exper­i­men­tal writ­ing, for stretch­ing your abil­i­ties and try­ing to find fresh ways to express ideas. Occa­sion­ally you end up with genius, but most of the time you result in pre­ten­tious, awk­ward prose that stick in the prover­bial craw of read­ers. This book is that writ­ing. There are plenty of exam­ples that I can give as evi­dence – but I shall stick with two rel­a­tively short ones:“His eyes scan the sil­hou­ette of my struc­ture and the slow motion makes my heart race. I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in some­thing that feels like the absence of courage.”The absence of courage? Are you fuck­ing kid­ding me? We have a word for that. I believe that is almost the dic­tio­nary def­i­n­i­tion of the word cow­ard. I would explain what was wrong with the rest of the para­graph too but I want to keep this review to a 10,000 word the­sis at max.“I always won­der about raindrops.I won­der about how they’re always falling down, trip­ping over their own feet, break­ing their legs and for­get­ting their para­chutes as they tum­ble right out of the sky toward an uncer­tain end.”…right.I get, artis­ti­cally, that Mafi wanted to expose her read­ers to the mind of a girl whose san­ity is frag­ile and ques­tion­able, and that she’s try­ing to show this through the prose. I don’t think the effect works or is done par­tic­u­larly well. I think the work­ings of a trou­bled mind would result in more than bad analo­gies and a bunch of num­bers. Despite the fact that Juliette’s back­story and premise is inter­est­ing, we still end up with the same mun­dane, cookie-cutter hero­ine that can be seen in the vast major­ity of Young Adult lit­er­a­ture. The only thing insane about this novel is how pre­dictable and trite it is.It would not be com­pletely unrea­son­able to ques­tion my san­ity in regards to read­ing Young Adult novels.When are pop­u­lar young adult authors going to pro­vide more to the char­ac­ter­i­za­tion of their main pro­tag­o­nists than: Irre­sistible, unique out­sider, in love with a guy?Can’t male pro­tag­o­nists have other qual­i­ties than: in love with main char­ac­ter, hot, tragic back­story to illicit exces­sive brooding?The entire premise of Shat­ter Me promised some­thing dif­fer­ent and new. Yet we still end up with the same bland old fare.The plot and pac­ing is awk­ward and cum­ber­some. Even when sit­u­a­tions are sup­posed to be tense, there is a sense of bore­dom and pre­dictabil­ity. I feel sad that this is yet again, another dis­ap­point­ing dystopian Young Adult novel that will join its sis­ters in the Mediocre Hall of I Can’t Be Stuffed.But, if you do decide to visit, at least you get a free shirt!  One last thing – the end­ing? That pissed me off the most! Xavier’s school for Mutants in Rebel­lion of the Oppres­sive Dystopian Régime? FML! And the suit, using that word loosely, that they pro­vide for her at the end? Yeah, that’s great… Doesn’t EVERY woman look at this suit and just say to them­selves, “Yes! I can’t wait to wear this! This doesn’t objec­tify me as a woman, degrade me as a human being and make an embar­rass­ment out of every­one involved. Not. At. All.It’s like the mutant ver­sion of fan­tasy armour for women. And as we all know, Women’s armour sucks.”This review also appears on my blog, Cuddlebuggery Book Blog. "
13,1,"I always wonder about raindrops.I wonder about how they’re always falling down, tripping over their own feet, breaking their legs and forgetting their parachutes as they tumble right out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It’s like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn’t seem to care where the contents fall, doesn’t seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors.Let me translate what Mafi was trying to say; ""It was raining.""This is one of, if not THE major problem of Shatter Me; she tries too hard to be clever and poetic and the story gets muddied along the way.I apologize for not going more in depth with this review, but I read this book over three months ago now and all I remember is that I hated it and it was incredibly poorly written. I think my status updates should show this pretty clearly, but to make this easier to see, I've decided to write this somewhat brief review and sort through a few of my updates as well.A device Mafi chooses to use early on is crossing striking out the words that ""crazy"" Juliette is ""really"" thinking. As the story goes on this device gets used less and less and so it feels more like Mafi just used it in the beginning for fun and to make her book look different from the rest of the young adult books out there, which, unfortunately, it is NOT, especially when you get to the romance. And that is what this story is: a romance, and a disgustingly sappy one at that. I don't think you'll be able to believe these favorite quotes of mine until you read them for yourself:""I'd like to cry into his eyes.""""His body presses closer and I realize I'm paying attention to nothing but the dandelions blowing wishes in my lungs.""""I'm suddenly desperate to drink in every drop of his being, desperate to savor every moment I've never known before. I suddenly worry that there's an expiration date on this phenomenon.The possibility of losing himThe possibility of losing himThe possibility of losing him is 100 years of solitude I don't want to imagine.Realization is a pendulum the size of the moon. It won't stop slamming into me.""""His heart is racing so fast I can't distinguish it from my own. It's 5,000 degrees in the air between us.""""I've run out of words. My pockets are full of letters I can't string together.""""I want to fall asleep to the sound of his heart beating in the atmosphere.""""His eyes are a midnight moment filled with memories, the only windows into my world.""""My heart fails for a moment.There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.""""James and Adam glance back at me and I melt into pink Play-Doh.""""I'm up.Spinning.Scanning.Scared.They found us is the only thing I can think of. My stomach is a flimsy crepe, my heart a raging woodpecker, my blood a river of anxiety.""""It's raining today. The sky is weeping for us.""""His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.""""The sun is revolving around the moon when he responds.""""I offer him a smile. Try to keep my organs from falling out. Hope the holes in my head aren't showing.""""My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.""""My neck snaps up to meet his dark eyes, his smooth voice, silky and strong.""""My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.""""I'm blushing through my bones.""""Adam pulls back just a tiny bit. Kisses my bottom lip. Bites it for just a second. His skin is 100 degrees hotter than it was a moment ago. His lips are pressed against my neck and my hands are on a journey down his upper body and I'm wondering why there are so many freight trains in my heart, why his chest is a broken harmonica.""And that, my friends, is that. I thought it was awful. Even if I didn't think the writing was trite and overwrought, later on it really starts to feel like she's borrowing heavily from the X-Men mythos (even though she claims she's never even seen the movies.) If you read the few quotes I've listed above and they're not your cup of tea, I'd say skip this one and try something else. Or maybe watch one of the X-Men movies instead; you'll get a much better portrayal of Rogue and a steamier love story. Mmm ... Wolverine."
14,2,"So, I actually didn't hate this as much as I thought I would. I enjoyed maybe thirty percent of it before it all went downhill, but... um... it really went downhill. I do not like to think about eyeballs. They just exist. I don't want to look at them. I hate this cover. But that's irrelevant. The hideous covers are irrelevant. But... is that Adam's eye? Because the only thing I took from this is that Adam's eyes are blue blue blue blue cobalt blossoming bruise clear as the midnight sky blue. Dark blue eyes dark brown hair sharp jawline strong lean frame.His eyes are the perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided.I've tried so hard to get those blue blue blue eyes out of my head but I know him I know him I know him. ...blue and bottomless...I'd recognize your eyes anywhere in the world. He still has the most unusually blue eyes I've ever seen. ...the deep dark blue of the eyes I've learned to swim in.His natural tan offsets a pair of eyes a shade of blue in a midnight sky. *aggressive coughing*Ma'am, this is a Wendy's. I actually didn't mind the writing, as long as it wasn't about Adam's eyes. The biggest complaint I see is usually related to the purple prose and long-winded metaphors and awkward phrases, but I enjoyed it...? To a point. I thought most of the strange metaphors were accurate, and the somewhat unconventional style of writing really helped to portray Juliette's trauma, which was my favorite part of the book. Too bad it all disappeared when she ✨fell in love.✨ Because that's just how the world works. I did find some, uh, interesting quotes:Raindrops are my only reminder that clouds have a heartbeat.I wonder about how [raindrops are] always falling down, forgetting their parachutes as they tumble out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It's like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn't seem to care where the contents fall, doesn't seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors. I am a raindrop. Someone picked up the sun and pinned it to the sky again, but every day it hangs a little lower than the day before. It's like a negligent parent who only knows one half of who you are. It never sees how its absence changes people. How different we are in the dark. I'm wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face.I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage. These words are vomit. This shaky pen is my esophagus. This sheet of paper is my porcelain bowl.1 word, 2 lips, 3 4 5 fingers form 1 first.1 corner, 2 parents, 3 4 5 reasons to hide. 1 child, 2 eyes, 3 4 17 years of fear. I wish I could stuff my mouth full of raindrops and fill my pockets full of snow. I wish I could trace the veins in a falling leaf and feel the wind pinch my nose.Every muscle every movement tightens, every vertebra in my spinal column is a block of ice. My eyes are 2 professional pickpockets, stealing everything to store away in my mind. My words wear no parachutes as they fall out of my mouth. My dreams are bloody and bleeding and blood is bleeding all over my mind and I can't sleep anymore. The prospect of Adam in pain is like a cold hand clutching my esophagus. I can shoot a hundred numbers through the chest and watch them bleed decimal points in the palm of my hand. I can rip the numbers off a clock and watch the hour hand tick tick tick its final tock just before I fall asleep. I can suffocate seconds just by holding my breath. I've been murdering minutes for hours and no one seems to mind. I could jump up to catch a breeze and live in its windblown ways forever. His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories. My lungs are sawing my rib cage in half, but I force them to process oxygen anyway. I take a few bites of oxygen. My face has been slapped by a hundred hands.And one of those hands is mine. It's like... here, I'll write an example. Here's a normal sentence:""I walk down the cold hall.""Now make it as awkward as possible:""I walk down the hall, the linoleum as cold as the corpses of the women and children they've killed, and my spine conducts enough electricity to power an entire city.""THE CHARACTERSJuliette: I didn't love her, but I liked the portrayal of trauma even though it suddenly disappeared halfway through. She needs to stop thinking in strikethroughs, but I don't have any real complaints. She's frustratingly stubborn at times, but she's a YA protagonist, obviously she's going to be stupid. Juliette can torture/kill people with her touch. She was locked away at a young age and has lived in solitary confinement ever since. She's a little kooky. I don't really care. Adam:Are you serious? I have to choose between an obsessed problematic psycho serial killer love interest and a blander-than-bland cardboard cutout organic whole wheat waffle love interest?? Adam is the organic whole wheat waffle. He's probably better for Juliette than the psycho serial killer, but apparently he's not the endgame LI. To summarize his character development, he went from a somewhat interesting mysterious weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend to... a very bland concerning weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend. This is instalove disguised as we-were-friends-as-kiddos-and-now-I-love-you. Which is probably worse. Adam's entire backstory is that he was hit as a kid once (this was never mentioned again) and he's spent his entire life searching for Juliette. Because logic. I wouldn't have minded the abuse subplot if it were actually a subplot instead of something mentioned once and thrown away. Maybe if it, I don't know, actually affected him, I would call it deep and move on.I was okay with him until he and Juliette had a little dialogue sequence. He tried to give her a blanket (this was before he knew that she had magical killing powers) and she told him not to touch her, but he was being all rebellious and she said it again, and then she said this, to which he replied:""Maybe I don't want you to.""He makes a harsh sound. ""I disgust you that much?""When someone tells you not to touch them, you back off. It's basic courtesy and respect. Don't assume it's about you. Warner:Warner is the obsessed problematic psycho serial killer. In case you were wondering. Some of my friends have been telling me Juliwarner is a better ship than Julikent. I beg to differ. Adam may be an organic whole wheat waffle, but at least he's not an edgy guy with problems that could be solved by therapy but he's too tough for therapy so there's that. Ahem. He's, uh, strangely obsessed with Juliette and continually tries to make advances on her even after she shows no interest in him. First of all, he needs to stop. Second of all, he's blond?? That was random, but since when are villains blond? I was picturing him with black hair until I searched up fanart to see what Juliette looked like and Warner was there with his blond hair. This is not okay. WORLDBUILDINGWhat worldbuilding? All I know is that there's something called The Reestablishment, which is a dystopian government that does bad stuff. What bad stuff? Who knows? And apparently the planet is all desolate now because the sky is gray. *looks outside* Oh no, the sky is gray. We must be living in a post-apocalyptic world because obviously clouds aren't a thing. I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it. 2 stars, get that cover away from me before I actually throw up"

16,5,"November 2017I picked this back up on a whim because I've been dealing with anxiety lately and wanted to return to something comforting, so I decided to annotate one of my paperback copies. And I gotta say, It's.... weird returning to book one. Ignite Me is my favorite book of all time, and rereading that book is such an immersive experience that I always come out of feeling empowered. This book, on the other hand, holds such a special place in my heart because it's so relatable that it hurts. From Juliette's panic to her awkwardness to her resilience to the writing style, everything just hurts so good. There's parts of me that I see in Juliette, and there's parts of Juliette that I wish I could be better at. It's just such a refreshing and inspirational book to read because it's about someone who has been handed the shittiest circumstances and still looks for the best in others, perseveres, and demands what's right for her. It's about learning to trust and realizing your worth and giving people second chances. FUCK i'm about to cry typing this review. I love Juliette so much and I love Tahereh even more for sharing a story that touches the deepest corners of my heart. It's truly a life-changing book for me. I’ve always read this as the story of a sad, self-conscious, self-loathing girl learning to see past obstacles to find love in herself and to let others in. however, i haven't read this since summer 2016, so my experience of reading this after the election & other #stressful political happenings opened my eyes to a completely new underside of the story. It had always been visible to me but was it never at the forefront, but this time I noticed it so vividly: this is also the story about a deeply hurt and angry girl who wants justice. People always criticize Juliette for being weak and annoying, especially in Unravel Me, but when she pushes back against her fear and stands up for herself, it's jaw-dropping. I envy her ability to know what's best for her and hold others' happiness and safety above her own even though she's gone through so much turmoil and deserves to be the person being looked out for. I used to think that Juliette gets suddenly really strong in Ignite Me, but reading this closely just showed how ready she was for that transformation. In my annotated editions, I use blue highlighter to mark parts where Juliette is really badass, and I didn't expect to use it a ton in this one, but it's everywhere. Juliette is a pure and fearless motherfucker. Even in book one she has powerful quotes like ""I'm not yours to want,"" and it challenges all the ideas Warner tries to install into her head.Which is where this book gets slippery. It's getting really, really difficult for me to reconcile Warner's actions in book one. I've definitely had others question how I ship Juliette with Warner after all he's put Juliette through in this book, and it's a valid concern. Every time I think about this book, i'm just kinda like “hahaha problematic warner but whatever.” But the more I reread, especially after ignite me came out, and ESPECIALLY during this particular reread, the more questions I have that I can only hope will now be explained in restore me. Don't get me wrong, this book still means so much to me because of juliette, but there’s no possible way for me to read this book with the mindset “omg i love warner!!” because he’s literally the villain and he does and says so many problematic, manipulative things. Honestly, I don't think it's fair to justify everything Warner does. While rereading this I was actually shocked at the amount of nasty things he says to her, that I obviously must have forgotten or blocked from my memory. Things like telling her she'll be miserable if she leaves him because no one else will want her, calling her a monster, professing his love for her even when she's clearly uncomfortable. In Unravel Me and Ignite Me he explains why he did these things and says that he regrets doing it, but... it seems to go so far in this book. I almost theorize that Tahereh must have written warner in book 1 to continue being a villain throughout the series, but there's way too many threads that suggest otherwise (ie. the introduction of the angst behind warner's mom, the fact that she felt ""electricity"" during their kiss, etc.)I feel like I could write an essay about this topic: the inconsistencies of Warner's personality, and whether or not it's justifiable to forgive him for his ""misjudgments"" of Juliette. It's just so strange to me that Adam & Kenji can say ""Warner is a lot of things, but he's not stupid,"" and yet Warner misreads her SO horribly. I mean, in the scene that he corners her and kisses her, he's literally saying ""I want you to choose me"" and ""I love you"" and later admits that he thought she was into it, EVEN THOUGH she literally said ""You're sick/you're a monster/etc."" and physically tried to punch him before he pinned her to the wall. If he's so smart, then why couldn't he tell that every time he talks to her, she's afraid and disgusted? Is it really that easy to mistake fear for excitement? Disgust for nerousness? His behavior is so coercive and manipulative, and even though I know he was just trying to get a reaction out of her so that she would abandon her fear and finally use her power, there's not nearly enough of an apology as I would expect for things of this magnitude. The reason why I don't consider Warner an outright misogynist is an incredibly nuanced (and long) discussion, but the difference between him and, say, a Colleen Hoover character is that while Warner is saying and doing problematic things, he is also being cast in a problematic light. He is literally the villain of this story for putting her in those situations. Had Juliette been like ""omg he's pinning me against a wall and threatening me, he's so dominating <3"" then that would a lot more concerning. But I'm gonna have to reread Unravel Me as well to refresh my memory on how Warner addresses these actions and words because I really don't think he apologized or explained himself well enough, and I think it's totally valid for Juliette to absolutely roast him in Restore Me for treating her so shittily. My outrage about it is fresh though, and maybe Juliette comes to terms with his actions in a later book that I've forgotten about.Also? Drag me, but Adam doesn't get enough credit in this book. I know we all love to shit on him--myself included--for the direction he goes in Ignite Me, but his place in her journey of self-discovery is vital. Imagine this book without Adam, without that glimmer of hope and self-love that he installs in her. He's the first person to reassure her of herself and humanize her. Sure, they're not right for each other in the end, but it's not okay to dismiss their entire relationship as bullshit, because he DID help her see herself as something other than a monster, and I can't even imagine what this series would have been like if it were only Juliette brooding alone in her room, dreading Warner, stuck there until Warner was forced to tell her the truth about his mom or until Anderson showed up to ask what was taking so long. Idk. There's so many important quotes from Adam in this book. Sometimes it falls into the type of narrative that feels like ""ugghhhh, she needed a boy to 'fix' her,"" but in reality, sometimes your friends have your back and reassure you of your worth, and sometimes your friends are more than your friends. I could make a LIST of all the positive things Adam said to Juliette in this book that caused her confidence to sky rocket, whereas almost everything Warner said installed panic and fear in her. So clearly I have conflicting feelings, but none of them intercede with the fact that I still cannot get over how much I adore this story. Sure, Warner sucks and I unironically wrote ""ew"" by half the things he says to her in this book, but watching Juliette's transformation and relating to her insecurities and thought process, as well as remembering how much I adored this book as a young teen, it's always going to be a priceless experience to me.July 2016I think this is my fourth or fifth time rereading it? I didn't plan to but my aunt showed interest in reading it and I jokingly offered to read it out loud to her, and she said yes. Thus, I proceeded to read this entire book out loud to her. And it was worth it.And what can I say? I love this book. I fucking love Juliette. Reading it out loud made me slightly more aware of how lame her stream of consciousness can sound, and how the metaphors become exhausting after a while. But I've sort of accepted that book one is always going to be slightly uncomfortable to reread just because of the fact that so much has changed by book 3 that this is almost cringe-worthy. There's so much set-up for world building that never occurs. Honestly this book is more of a 3 star rating, but I can't bring myself to lower it. It was due for a reread since it had been just about two years, and, like always, I noted several things that I had missed or forgotten since I read it last! August 2015I'm not quite sure why i've never uploaded a review on goodreads for this book. I mean, I feel like it kind of goes without saying how I feel about it but ya know. This is my favorite series. If you're sick of dystopian and never want to read one ever again, make an exception for this one. Ignore the fact that the entire fandom (and myself) has probably majorly spoiled you. But this book. Holy shit. The writing. YES. The characters. YES. The plot. YES. The range of emotions. YES. I could tell you the things wrong with it, but no book is perfect. But if you want a book with characters that you will not be able to get out of your head and with a plot that will have you reading an entire trilogy in one sitting, this book is your friend. reread: July 2014"
17,1,"This book is pretty darn bad. This book is pretty darn bad.Oh, darn, did I miss the point of the strikethroughs?"
18,1,"Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestIt's not easy being Queen of Literary Trash. Between YA and bodice-rippers, I read more ""bad"" books than most elitist snobs will see in their entire lifetime. But then, I consider myself a connoisseur of the so-called trashy arts. There are two kinds of ""bad"" books. There are the books that tell good stories and while they aren't highbrow literature, they are still fun to read and if you can let go of your snobbery long enough to enjoy them, will perform quite serviceably as quality entertainment. Then there are the books that are just bad, and have no redeeming value at all.I had friends warn me about SHATTER ME. It's apparently infamous for the ""creative"" metaphors that the author likes to use. It's also yet another attempt to cling to the coattails of THE HUNGER GAMES (although it's more like DIVERGENT than THE HUNGER GAMES, which if you know my thoughts on DIVERGENT, you will know is not a compliment, coming from me). The premise is pretty undeveloped. Juliette has been in captivity for just under a year when she accidentally killed a boy by touching him. Her touch, you see, is deadly. She's like Rogue, from X-men. One touch, and your life force is hers.It's set on a dying Earth but why and how it's dying are incredibly vague. We've apparently allowed a fascist-tolerant (if not outright fascist) regime to gain power, which I would say is not really giving the world a whole lot of credit, but on the other hand I'm a liberal living in the United States right now, so on the OTHER hand, maybe future Earth is totally stupid enough to do that. It seems to happen a lot in YA dystopians, to the point where the reader begins to wonder if all it takes to start a fascist regime is a kickstarter and a special license. What matters is that resources are thin and there is not a lot of food and there are parts of the world that are radioactive(?) and for some reason, some people (especially Juliette) have mutant-like powers for Reasons and this is the world we live in.Both love interests are, conveniently, immune to Juliette's power. Because I guess it wouldn't be much of a romance if the book took the MC Hammer ""Can't Touch This"" approach to courtship. There is instalove up the wazoo in here, and even when Juliette finds out that Adam was put in her cell to spy on her under the guise of being a fellow prisoner, she forgives him stunningly quickly, and is constantly telling us how much she wants to touch him. She wants to touch the villain, Warner (I'm sorry but I can't take you seriously when I'm picturing the dancing frog mascot of the WB), too, although it's a traitorous body sort of desire to touch, the I-love-to-hate-how-I-hate-to-love-you type. Warner was the biggest potential sell of this series to me because I love villainous love interests but he's too creepy, even for me. Between the constant unwanted pet names and the really disturbing ""I could just take a bite out of you""-type comments, this dude was about one villain notch away from singing a Tim Curry song.Then there's the writing itself, which can be broken down into three categories: OMG, WTF, and LOL.OMG:Every organ in my body falls to the floor (68).I want to rip up the carpet and sew it to my skin (163).My jaw is dangling from my shoelace (310).WTF:I'm wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my face (6).There are 15,000 feelings of disbelief hole-punched in my heart (40).My throat is a reptile, covered in scales (172).I'm blushing through my bones (326).LOL:I wondered if your eye color meant you saw the world differently (151).My heart is parasailing in the springtime (286).The author also makes two other attempts at being creative, which are overuse of the strikethrough tool and overuse of numbers, written as numerals instead of being spelled out. Which, if you ask me, is 1 bad idea because not only does it look unprofessional as 0 other writers do this, but 2, comes across as overly gimmicky and makes you feel like you're reading cast-offs from a teenager's poetry journal as she tries - and fails - to channel Ellen Hopkins and/or Rupi Kaur.If you like this book, good for you, I guess. I personally couldn't stand it. It felt incredibly derivative, and from the woe-is-me beginning to the yay-I've-got-a-hypersexualized-supersuit ending, there was just way too much I ended up side-eying in this book for me to enjoy it. I don't think I'll be reading the sequels, not even for the lols.1 star"
19,4,"You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!This was something...and I liked it. Okay so the first 200 pages were like the dullest,cheesiest romance bullshit,like the level of cheesiness was above normal,and you know how I feel about that.I sometimes thought to quit,but god,I am glad I didn't.You know when you loose all the hope but then one things clings and you see the light again? Omega Point was that for me.Like my thoughts about this book changed 100 percent.There are 3 things that I truly cherish in life: 1.Girls in tight outfits, 2.Dragons, 3.Superpowers and that's what I got in the last 50 pages and it is enough for me,enough to continue with the series.I don't know why but I got a vibe of fantastic 4,maybe with Wilson hugging himself twice if you know what I mean.One thing I can't wrap my mind of,one things I can't get is the hype for Warner.He is like the worst character in the book ,he is like Joffrey from Game of Thrones for me and if you know me just a little you would know how much I truly deeply hate him and I am hoping he gets killed.But absolutely get the hype for Kenji,like that guy is a legend.I feel like we are already buddies.Such a cool humor,got me laughing out loud.In the other hand Juliette,I don't know why but I got the feeling like I remember her from somewhere.I like her like a lot,she cries much,and she literally has a million chances to kill people she wants to kill but doesn't,but god she is beautiful.I don't know some people are just beautiful,now in what they look,not in what they say,just in what they are,and she was beautiful to me that way.I will definitely continue the series.I like the plot,and now with superpowers it is a million times better.I recommend this book to every reader out there,it has a different writing style,some call it beautiful and unique,and I can't disagree,it's just that I didn't find it beautiful.It was annyoing like hell,especially at the beginnings.I know I will get a bunch of replies for not liking Warner,but seriously people what's there to like?"
20,4,"I seriously don’t know why it took me so long to dig my claws into this book, but I definitely know that I don’t regret doing it! ;-)“Shatter Me” was an awesome read and I enjoyed it immensely! There were so many things I loved about this book and whilst it is true that many people complained about the writing style, I have to admit that I actually loved it. “Hope is hugging me, holding me in its arms, wiping away my tears and telling me that today and tomorrow and two days from now I will be just fine and I'm so delirious I actually dare to believe it.”I think it was something new and extraordinary and I loved the way Juliette described her world. The repetitions, her thoughts, the things she thought and even the truths she vehemently refused to admit. It all gave me a very good picture of her character and her mind, the many things she must have gone through shaping her into a person that distrusts everyone and desperately tries not to feel anything. XD Of course she’s failing but this actually only made her even more likeable. *lol*See where I’m getting at? Tahereh Mafi knows exactly what she’s doing and she really managed to drag me into her world. Yes, I confess! I’m officially hooked now and I’m soo going to read all of the other books! ;-PSo be prepared to read many reviews! *LOL*Okay, enough of the threats and right back to the characters! Oh, the characters! There’s so much to tell! XDFAIR WARNING: Mild spoilers lying ahead of you! ;-)Juliette: At the beginning of the book you don’t even know her name. Everything you know is that she’s been imprisoned for ages and that she’s more than just a little insecure. Considering her ability this is no surprise though, the fact she can hurt and even kill people with just the touch of her fingertips making it kind of hard to be all too sociable. Juliette may not talk a lot but she sees everything and she’s more than just observant. She obviously also seems to have a knack for poetry and I really enjoyed the way she used her words. “All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”Adam: That boy is hot as hell and Juliette’s new cell mate! Could a girl ask for more? Dark hair, blue eyes, awesome and muscular body! *drools* Okay, okay! I’m back on track! *lol* Yeah, as you can see Adam is just awesome boyfriend material and it’s no wonder that they kind of hit it off! He’s caring and gentle and he always tries to understand Juliette’s thoughts. I liked him from the beginning and I’m really curious to find out how things are going to proceed in the next books. =)Sidenote: Is it just me or does he never tell Juliette that he loves her? O_o I thought this was kind of odd. Juliette told him she loved him but as far as I could read he never returned it…. Did I miss anything? xDGod, Juliette, I'd follow you anywhere. You're the only good thing left in this world.”Warner: Oh my god! Warner! Gosh! Warner! Argh! Warner! *babbling mess* That boy, that boy gave me all the feels! Good and bad! Happy and angry! Disgusted and longing for more! *lol* I wanted him to touch Juliette and I wanted her to touch him! I just couldn’t decide if I wanted it because I wanted him to hurt or because I wanted them to make out! *LOL* What is it with me and the villains? Why do I love them so much!? XD First Maven and now Warner, I think I’m going to die! >_< Oh, well I think I’m supposed to say something about his character as well so here I go: He’s ruthless when he is with his soldiers but he is gentle whenever he is with Juliette. He seems to care about her a LOT and he even admitted that he loved her! But why does he hurt her so much? Warner is a big question mark and some sort of mystery I’m determined to solve. So yesh, I’m so going to read “Destroy Me” after I wrote this review! XD His smile is laced with dynamite. ""Go to sleep.""""Go to hell.""He works his jaw. Walks to the door. ""I'm working on it.”""I'm nineteen years old."" He clarifies. ""I'm a fairly impressive specimen for my age, I know."" Kenji: I loved Kenji! That boy is so funny and I really enjoyed his sassy demeanour. He’s constantly hitting on Juliette and his character gives the book a hilarious edge. I want more of him and actually can’t wait to meet him again! =)His grin is crooked. ""I don't know why, but I kind of like it when you threaten me.""""That's because you're an idiot.""""Nah."" He shakes his head. ""You've got a sexy voice makes everything sound naughty.""So, if you haven’t already figured it out: YES I liked “Shatter Me” and I can easily recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a nice and short-lived page turner! =)Enjoy! ;-P"
21,2,I’m unhauling this whole series and canceled my preorder of the new book. I’m changing my views and cleaning house. Sucks these books look damn good on the bookshelf though!! I will always love Warner though. Picture by George Redhawk Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
22,5,"By the way, check out this fan made poster for the movie, if there ever was one.Made by skellingt0n on deviantART.I looove it! Exactly how I would picture a movie poster for this book._________________I read this book in one sitting.For five hours, I read this. It was a school night and I stayed up all night. That's how much this book pulled me.I know that there are many people who didn't like this book, some even hate it, but... Gah, it was just so awesome to me! It's definitely one of those books that pulled me in and refused to let go. I loved every minute of it, and I guess I see why it's getting all the hate─insta-love, lack of world-building, the writing style, etc etc─but... I don't know, something about this book just really really wowed me, and it was fucking awesome in my eyes.Also, the author herself is awesome as well. <3 Here is her YouTube channel where you can see all of her adorableness. :DOverall, in spite of all the hate this book is getting, I absolutely loved it, and can't wait for the sequel."
23,2,"(2.5?) The lack of world building is one of my main issues with this book (even though it seems like things will be explained in book 2... a full book with little world building is boring!).I didn't love the writing and the characters felt very one dimensional.Kinda felt like another YA dystopian world with a love triangle and an incredibly pretty main character - even after spending over 6 months isolated, underfed... and the fact that she hasn't seen herself in the mirror in 3 years... Her beauty is mentioned in pretty awkward moments.If it wasn't for the fact that people say the series becomes way better after book 1 I would stop but I'll give the second book a try!"
24,2,It's been 27 hours since I started reading this book.1620 minutes since I invited my doom.97200 seconds since my brain cells started disintegrating dyingdyingdyingdyingDead. They are dead. I couldn't do anything to help them.I'm pathetic weak stupid dumb idiot.
25,1,"dnf @ p. 127.Yeah, well, you know how is this.15 y/o me would have loved this book, she would. You know, I'll create a new shelf specifically for old YA books of 2012 that back in then I'd have probably loved, or at least liked, to put in there this kind of disappointments, ok? I need name suggestions because my last braincell just died trying to finish this book.So, we have Juliette, a girl who can kill or torture people with her touch. She killed someone before and for that, she was sent to an asylum. She has a new cell partner, Juliette hasn't touched anybody in 3 years, or talked with somebody in that time. And she thinks she knows her partner: a guy named Adam. And, oh, she does: he was her classmate in third grade, but he doesn't remember her.In within a couple weeks, Juliette falls for Adam. She recognizes her blue eyes, and she describes them in several ways that made me realize that that kind of blue is now tattooed on my brain. Suddenly, some armed guys take Juliette and Adam out of the asylum and take them to a thing called The Reestablishment, that took everything from her, yada, yada, yada.And turns out that, oh wow!, Adam is a soldier and lied to her (in what? idk, y'all, because he didn't talk to her a lot in those two weeks), and betrayed her (betrayed you how? You two only met for a couple of weeks and you barely talked to him). Now, this new guy appears: Warner. He wants Juliette on his team for torture rebels and that shit :DWriting.The writing was ok? I guess? I don't know, man. Some metaphors were cool, but others were exaggerated. The pacing was ok for a YA dystopian book, idk, the metaphors were taking away everything logical here. I mean, it wasn't bad to hate it, but I was getting confused sometimes. For me, a Spanish native speaker, the pacing, the writing and the level of English was cool and understandable.But, the famous but, the thing with the numbers got me spending more braincells that I can usually afford. There's a reason why I'm a lit student and I quit math and numbers a long time ago. I also noted that there's a lot of striked lines and words repeated 3 times times times, which got me confused, and tired.WorldbuildingUhm, this sucked. Juliette only described two places. The asylum (and barely, bc she only described her cell) and the famous Reestablishment, but even like that, it wasn't described at all. It was poor. The sky is grey, but, isn't like that when it's rainy?Here: a pic of grey sky that I took of the back of my house, lmao. Please, ignore the bad quality that GR added to it.Characters.I must admit that Juliette's trauma was well protrayed, it was ok and tolerable. But then.... she fell in love. Sometimes, I get upset and pissed off because she was annoying as hell. But, I don't blame her or the author: that book was written back in 2011 I guess, so, it was normal that female MC's in those books were annoying to the point that you wanted to throw them a shoe. Also, hun, you should have killed Warner when he asked you to touch him. Get rid of that asshole. EVEN IF I KNOW THAT THEY'RE ENDGAME, LMAO.Also, Juliette says in a part: I'd like to cry into his eyes. hOW, ON EARTH, ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT????Adam is so bland and boring. And oh, plot twist, he does remember Juliette. Oh, wow, you didn't see that coming? (As a hard Pietro Maximoff fan, that line hurts so bad, please, don't touch me). And he wants to run away with her. He wasn't interesting at all. He was the only nice kid with Juliette, but they never talked, lmao.The famous Aaron Warner. Well, what do you want me to say? He's a fucking dick. Those 4 words resume my feelings toward him. I hate whenever he calls Juliette love just hit him with a rock. And the only smart braincell of Juliette finally says something logical.""I'd really rather die than eat your food and listen to you call me love""Finally, some guts.Warner is a psycho killer with daddy issues and feels like he's some sorta god or what I know, but he's just an annoying ass who should ✨fuck✨off✨. Juliette asks him why he's being nice to her... Honey, he's not. He just wants something from you: your power. Have a little bit of self love. He's also a stalker and a creepy guy.""I know everything about you, love"". He grins. ""I've wanted you for a very long time. I've waited forever for you to be ready. I'm not going to let you go so easily.""""You should be thanking me.""Yes, Warner, ✨fuck✨you✨.Juliette saying that she wants to crush Warner's spine is a GREAT MOOD.People kept saying to me that I was going to love him on the novella about him, but if I dnf this book, I'd hardly read the next ones, or the novellas.My big ass question for the Warner fans are: how can you love him? He's a dick 90% of the time and a psycho the other 10%. Does he get over his daddy issues and goes to therapy? Because if he does, that would be a very good first step.The only nice quote that I liked it was this:""I am a being comprised of letters, a character created by sentences, a figment of imagination formed through fiction.""Look, if you liked Shatter me book and series, it's fine. I'm actually glad that people enjoyed this while I was trying to figure it out if the problem is not me or what. If you also loved Warner, it's ok, I get it. Perhaps he changes and become something good. For those who liked, loved and enjoyed Shatter me: I admire you because it's something that seems pretty far away from me, impossible is more accurate.I should stop reading hyped books of 2012 because they're not for me anymore. Once more, back in that year, I'd loved them, but now, I feel really old to read 2012 dystopian YA books with annoying MC's and really weird love interests.""The sky is raining bricks into my skull.""Cool, I wanna throw one at her.Yeah, sorry not sorry, guys.See ya in the next chapter of big hype big lie. Stay tuned."
26,2,"~ 2 stars ~This is the most painfully underwhelming and mediocre book I have ever read in my life. If Juliette and Adam make out ONE more time, I might have to drench myself with gasoline and light myself on fire. I've read worse books. But that's not a compliment.What I disliked:• This book basically sidelined every important thing in this book for the romance. The romance with such an uninteresting person, that it's actually funny. They are literaly running for their lives, but somehow have time to be all lovey-dovey. There was scarcely any world-development, nor anything of substance. Like please, if you asked me what this book is about, I couldn't answer you. • Adam: He is so bland. Someone under one of my updates said he was as bland as white bread (Credit) and dry bread (Credit). I liked both comparisons and very much accurate. I can't believe that he's so unamusing, that I want to know more about Warner Bros™, than him. Someone give this man a personality. Some spice. Please. Having blue eyes is not a personality trait. • Warner: I don't see how he can have such drastic character development. He's possessive, arrogant, and is everything I typically dislike. But at the very least, because everyone loves him, I'll grudgingly keep an open mind. Another comparison was him to soggy bread (Credit) and yes. • Juliette: I don't really like her either. She had moments that I liked, but all the potential she could have had, was wasted on the romance making her seem like a love-sick child. Stop with all the touching. That's all she talks about. She just obsesses over Adam. She literally threw herself at the first man that gave her an ounce of attention and respect. • That ending was terrible. It didn't even feel like it ended. The epilogue was the same scene as the last chapter, and it added nothing. I don't feel like I read a full book, it seems like half a book. • The figurative language: it was so out of hand. It didn't make sense, and without it, I would have really liked Mafi's writing style. Not to mention the fact that some of the dialogue was absolute cringe. Here are some examples: I can shoot a hundred numbers through the chest and watch them bleed decmil points in the palm of my hand. I can rip the numbers off a clock and watch the hour hand suffocate seconds just by holding My breathe. I've been murdering numbers for hours and no one seems to mindIt's 8:00 in the morning and I'm wearing a dress the color of dead forests and old tin cans""You don't have to look away,"" he says. He says it with a smile the size of Jupiter.• The eye color descriptions drove me crazy. Will Herondale has some tough competition. I don't understand the obsession. And they were shoved down my throat approximately every 5 pages or so as if it was relevant. Final thoughts: Those were the main things I had an issue with, but there are definitely more. The only thing that made this digestible were the short chapters and pace. Overall, I don't think I can recommend, but so many people love this book, it just wasn't for me. But I will be continuing with the series for the sake of curiosity. Buddy read this book with human who decided to graciously sacrifice her braincells in order to do this with me!"
27,5,I WANT WARNER SO BAD ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY
28,1,"usually I am nostalgic and like to look back on the past to see how much I’ve grown, but this review was just..... so embarrassing. I want to sink in a hole every time I get a notification that someone liked this in 2020. so! I would like to keep just these two lines from 2017:- my first reaction when I finished the book was: thank god it’s over- “He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter.”—Jupiter is not small... Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system......// buddy read with american, british, and german (sorry for hating on your fave book xoxo)(all the other BR people rated this 3 stars and higher, I love being the only hater <3)"
29,3,"  “All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”  The story unfolds slowly and is narrated in the first person by Juliette. Initially, I was confused because there were so many strikings and Juliette's obsession with numbers was something that potentially annoyed me and I didn't quite understand why it was written that way. It was only later that I realized that all of it was hinting at Juliette's state of mind, and in that aspect, it was a job well done because I didn't for a second feel like I was reading a book, it was more of reading Juliette's thoughts, getting to know more of her character, her opinions about the world, her parentage and her past as if she herself was conversing with me. I was thoroughly invested in the story, awaiting with curiosity what would happen next. The story opens in a room with one window, four walls, and 144 square feet. Juliette is left alone, without a human being anywhere near her for about 264 days, and the reason? She has been gifted  cursed with a touch so lethal that she doesn't trust her own self around any other human entity. Later, a man who goes by the name  Adam Kent  is sent into her room and she remembers that she has known him since he was a schoolboy and that she could never forget his blue eyes. She refuses to speak to him and silently scribbles in her notebook when one day, another man, supposedly the leader of Sector 45 takes her as a prisoner (more or less), and the series of events that follow changes her life. The characters are beautifully portrayed and Warner and Kenji had my heart from the beginning. I knew something about Warner was off, that he may not be the monster he was portrayed to be or that there's a solid reason behind why he is the way he is, and it only made me  love  root for him. I don't have many thoughts about Adam. Kenji is truly one of a kind. When everyone is serious about the apprehensions of what's about to happen, he had his own ways to lighten the mood, be it with his flirtations with Juliette or swearing all the way, and successfully managed to make me smile.The story was well-paced with equal emphasis on the characters and the plot surrounding them. A story about a girl with a magical yet lethal touch. The incinerating culture of The Reestablishment. A tale that stands out despite its cratering imperfections. "
