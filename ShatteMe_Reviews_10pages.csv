0,1,"This is not a dystopia, it is a romance. This is not a novel, it is a collection of similes and metaphors, most of which do not make sense. I originally gave Shatter Me two stars because that's my sort of kneejerk reaction to books I don't like, but after thinking it over for a while, I can't recall positive about it that would justify a rating of more than one star.You're probably assuming - correctly - that I went into this book with low expectations. This is completely true. Any so-called ""dystopia"" with a runway model on the front cover leaves me feeling sceptical. However, I was also prepared to allow myself to be surprised; a lot of my friends loved this and one of the biggest criticisms didn't actually bother me - purple prose. I think there's a fine line in writing between the pretty and the purplish and different readers will define it in their own way. For example, some reviewers thought that was just a mess of bloated purple prose, whereas I thought it was one of the most beautiful books I read last year. I have a high tolerance level for flowery writing. But...'s numerous metaphors, similes, and endless descriptions just didn't make sense. What is this?:I just... This is one example floating around in there, but every second sentence is like this! That's not even mentioning the annoying strike-outs. Trust me, no really, , I thought people were being overly picky when they said the crossed out sentences were annoying. I actually thought it sounded interesting, unusual, especially because the whole thing is meant to be written in a notebook and I cross stuff out in mine all the time. People didn't exaggerate: it will most likely drive you crazy.However, there was one thing that for me was even more annoying than the descriptions, the similes, the strikes, and that was the stupid repetition thing: Again, if it had been used once, or sparingly even, then it wouldn't be so bad. I may have thought it was an interesting literary technique. But had way way way too much of everything (see what I did there?).And story? What story? *sigh* It's about time we just opened up an entirely new genre called ""Dystopian Romance"" or alternatively ""Romantic Dystopia"", though I don't wish to be pessimistic, I'm pretty sure half the new releases of 2012 will make it into that category. If there was a story then it drowned amidst the waves of overenthusiastic and flowery prose. This reminded me of in that the dystopia was there to make the romance interesting. One was certainly there to complement the other, but it was the wrong way around.Also... kissing when you are fleeing for your lives?? I'm sure this is not the correct way of things, right? And yet it occurs in way too many young adult books. I'm like: ""run, run, run!"" but the characters are too busy swapping saliva. I must be old-fashioned in my thinking that staying alive is kinda important.There are a lot of things that, had they been there, could have convinced me to up this to two stars. One star ratings make me feel sucky. But I'm sorry guys, I wasn't even entertained. The beginning was intriguing but there was so little plot beyond the romance that it quickly became tedious. I hated the prose, I felt nothing either way for the characters, this series ends here for me."
1,1,"I know many found this book to have a very unique writing style, but I can't help but think how terrible and awkwardly written it was.The writing:Mafi's style of writing varies. Let me categorize.This doesn't even make sense writing:""I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage.""""He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter."":""Every organ in my body falls to the ground.""""There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.""""My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.""""My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.""""My stomach drops onto my knees.""""I blush through my bones.""""My spine is conducting enough electricity to power a city."":""I blush.""""I blush.""""His lips part. Close.""""I blush.""""I blush.""""His lips part. Close.""""I blush.""""I blush.""""His lips part. Close."":""I am an old creaky staircase when I wake up.""""Warner thinks Adam is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations.""Do I need to explain how shitty this writing is? And yes, before people yell at me and tell me that I don't understand metaphors... I do. But the excessive use of them and just metaphors themselves are maybe not my thing.:Juliette does nothing but sulk around, wait for death, and whine. I saw no potential of her growing.Adam is just there...Warner is just... almost there? I must admit that a few times, he had potential to be a good character. I thought he was the only character that brought something. He made me cringe. He made me angry, made me feel uncomfortable. He was getting there. At least then I felt like he had some sort of purpose in this story. Then he would say something so cheesy, so inconsistent with his character, and just downright stupid that I lost all hope in him.Kenji was just fucking annoying.:Besides Juliette's constant whining and lameness and the cringeworthy romances, this story was just a sadder and lamer version of X-Men. It had too many X-Men vibes going on.:Mafi, if you wanted to capture me with unique prose, thinking that if you repeated phrases fifty times every once in a while, had painful metaphors, and an unnecessary abundance of irritating striking texts, thenShe speaks like that in real life...?"
2,0,"MY PRECIOUS IS NOW SIGNED BY TAHEREH!!! I can die of happiness now <3Oh, and if you decide to cast Alex Pettyfer as Warner I would be cool with that.Okay, I have not properly reviewed this series since I read it a year ago (and I don't think I ever can because it would be ridiculously long and the book is so quotable that I would literally be citing the entire thing) but Shatter Me is one of my favorite series of And it has my FAVORITE LOVE INTEREST of Butttt, to anyone considering it, watch this: . I just found that fan video the other day and I can't stop watching it. I'm sorry but if that doesn't make you want to read this book you do not have a soul. READ. THIS. BOOK. You will either love it or hate it (depending on how you feel about prose) but if you love it thanPS this review basically is a dedication to Alex Pettyfer as Warner. YOU ARE WELCOME."
3,2,"Juliette describing Adam’s eyes“...perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided”“…careful, curious”“… 2 buckets of rainwater; deep, fresh, clear”“…blue and bottomless like the deepest part of the ocean”“…tight”“…as tight as his fists as tight as the strain in his arms”“…bottomless blue”“…blue blue blue”“…midnight moment filled with memories, the only windows into my world”“… always shining the darkness”“…two pools of perfection, open, honest, humble”“…a shade of blue in a midnight sky”“…like a white-hot poker pressed against my skin”“…touching every inch of my body”“…locked into mine”“… is fixed on me: calm, unflappable; 2 buckets of river water at midnight. I’d like to cry into his eyes”I’ve never been a purple prose type of girl. A book that will forever remain nameless spoke of “leaking wombs” and well it made me . It also introduced me to the entire concept of purple prose. Prose can be beautiful. I’ve read plenty of books where the writing touches me deeply and the author is simply writing about the sunset, or a walk in the park, or the plight of the poor. If the author is able to actually tell a story without distracting the reader with the prose, I’m all for it.That is not the case with “Shatter Me”. “Shatter Me” was over-done. It was tiring, distracting, and silly.At some point, I was overwhelmed by the prose and eager for the story. And don’t get me started about the crossing out of passages in the book. It was something I did not enjoy.Overall-I’m curious to see where the author can go since it is clear that she can write. I think someone needed to edit her prose down to a more controllable level so that people could enjoy the story rather than cringe with every every every incident of prose."
4,1,"I deserve a medal for finishing this book.Like, the Olympic gold medal in the Anti-DNF Games, people.*Rant Ahead*It took me three months to finish this book.THREE. (Not 3, Miss Mafi)Now, normally, I would have tossed this book out the window like an overwrought Bradley Cooper, being that I AM the queen of the heartless page 15 DNF; however, I find that I have a harder time DNFing something when I am 1) Reading a physical copy as opposed to a digital copy, and 2) When I already OWN books two and three and am hoping to FUCK I didn't waste my money.That said, this book annoyed me on several different levels.1) Juliette's ""power"" or ""glitch"" or whatever the hell it is, is never fully explained in detail. It's skirted around in a mass of overwrought metaphors and complete bullshit.2) Said overwrought metaphors.3) The writing itself in general.Despite having a degree in English and Literature, I am usually pretty easygoing about typos and grammar, especially when it comes to self-published stuff.I mean just LOOK at the slang and vernacular I use in my reviews.I am NOT a hard ass about this stuff.HOWEVER.When I am holding a professionally published, FINISHED copy of a mass produced book and it contains strikeouts, sentences starting in lowercase letters, and numbers one through ten incorrectly placed in number form, e.g., ""Juliette has 2 hands and 1 brain,"" my inner grammar maven's granny panties get twisted so far up her ass, it's impossible to focus.I mean, I GET that this was all a stylistic choice, etc. That the sporadic, all over the place, SHITTY sentence structure was supposed to reflect Juliette's instability, or whatever the fuck it was supposed to reflect, but I just can't get behind starting a sentence with ""4,"" my friends.Add to that the insta-love between Juliette and Adam and the spindly world-building of a completely unclear and poorly wrought dystopian society and you have a wreck of a book that merely has a pretty cover.Now I am left with the crushing decision of whether or not I try book two (since I, like an idiot, already bought it) or if I just march the whole trilogy down to my favorite used book store and hope the fact that this series is about to have a new book published gets me top dollar.Decisions, decisions."
5,0,"4/5 stars.The only reason I gave this book 4 and not 5 stars is because I really dislike Adam and Juliette as a couple.Juliette “loved” Adam because he was the only one who was nice to her, the only one who noticed her when they were kids. It hasn't changed. He can touch her, and she- the girl who has never been touched, the girl whose whole life she wanted to feel loved- she “fell in love” with him.Now, I'm pretty sure she's confused between love and this new feeling she loves, the feeling that someone touches her and that someone loves her.She’s a poor girl after all, she never felt how a person cared about her, I can understand why she’s so sure she’s in love with Adam.Adam himself, well, let’s say I'm not so fond of him when he's with her. He’s insanely cringe in my opinion. The way he always wanted her, the way he looked for her everywhere. I’m sorry, It's too cliche, yuck.And Juliet? You may notice that she enjoys his touch more than him specifically. It's not love. Come on. Nope.But I really like Adam in general, he’s very sweet. And of course Juliette loves Adam in general, but... I don’t think their love is true. Idk, let’s see how it’ll work out.The plot itself was amazing. The idea is amazing. Kenji is amazing. Warner is amazing. Oh, Warner is SO AMAZING. He's a cute psychopath, it's the perfect combination. I love you Warner.Ooookaayyy, I'm ready for the second book."
6,1,"“I always wonder about raindrops.I wonder about how they're always falling down, tripping over their own feet, breaking their legs and forgetting their parachutes as they tumble right out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It's like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn't seem to care where the contents fall, doesn't seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors.I am a raindrop.”"
7,5,"*reread for a special vid*—————————————-(Reread)finally writing a review for one of my favourite series of all time.Shatter me, especially the first book has in my opinion alot of death and emotions, mostly dark sad and depressed ones in this book but I think it is a great representation of what it would feel like to be locked up for so long without being able to touch another person.her reaction to the other person, Adam, is very realistic and the way Juliette is obsessed with numbers makes alot of sense.The enemy in this book is great and obviously the sarcastic best friend bring joy to this book.Cannot wait to have others experience the character development and overall growth that juliette goes through"
8,1,"Oh, Juliette, SHUT THE FUCK UP ALREADY.Insufferable whiny bitch."
9,1,this book is what i see in the corner of my room while having sleep paralysis
10,0,"""He's wrong he's so wrong he's more wrong than an upside-down rainbow.""ok."
11,5,"I literally read 300 pgs in one sitting and finished the whole book in 24 hrs. Haven't done that with a book in a LONG time. That's how much I loved it. I love that we jump straight into the plot. That made it such a fast read.And THE WRITING STYLE. I know it's not going to be for everyone, but I loved the metaphors, crossed-out words, and repeated words/phrases. It really puts us in Juliette's head and shows us her mental state after being in solitary confinement for 260+ days. And I love how the writing style evolves as Juliette's confidence and state of mind evolve.So far, I loveeee Adam and how caring he is, and I'm so intrigued to see how Warner's character evolves (even tho I hate him right now). Shatter Me series reading vlog coming soon."
12,2,"Shat­ter Me, oth­er­wise known as: When Cre­ative Writ­ing Class Goes Wrong.I am all for exper­i­men­tal writ­ing, for stretch­ing your abil­i­ties and try­ing to find fresh ways to express ideas. Occa­sion­ally you end up with genius, but most of the time you result in pre­ten­tious, awk­ward prose that stick in the prover­bial craw of read­ers. This book is that writ­ing. There are plenty of exam­ples that I can give as evi­dence – but I shall stick with two rel­a­tively short ones:“His eyes scan the sil­hou­ette of my struc­ture and the slow motion makes my heart race. I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in some­thing that feels like the absence of courage.”The absence of courage? Are you fuck­ing kid­ding me? We have a word for that. I believe that is almost the dic­tio­nary def­i­n­i­tion of the word cow­ard. I would explain what was wrong with the rest of the para­graph too but I want to keep this review to a 10,000 word the­sis at max.“I always won­der about raindrops.I won­der about how they’re always falling down, trip­ping over their own feet, break­ing their legs and for­get­ting their para­chutes as they tum­ble right out of the sky toward an uncer­tain end.”…right.I get, artis­ti­cally, that Mafi wanted to expose her read­ers to the mind of a girl whose san­ity is frag­ile and ques­tion­able, and that she’s try­ing to show this through the prose. I don’t think the effect works or is done par­tic­u­larly well. I think the work­ings of a trou­bled mind would result in more than bad analo­gies and a bunch of num­bers. Despite the fact that Juliette’s back­story and premise is inter­est­ing, we still end up with the same mun­dane, cookie-cutter hero­ine that can be seen in the vast major­ity of Young Adult lit­er­a­ture. The only thing insane about this novel is how pre­dictable and trite it is.When are pop­u­lar young adult authors going to pro­vide more to the char­ac­ter­i­za­tion of their main pro­tag­o­nists than: Irre­sistible, unique out­sider, in love with a guy?Can’t male pro­tag­o­nists have other qual­i­ties than: in love with main char­ac­ter, hot, tragic back­story to illicit exces­sive brooding?The entire premise of Shat­ter Me promised some­thing dif­fer­ent and new. Yet we still end up with the same bland old fare.The plot and pac­ing is awk­ward and cum­ber­some. Even when sit­u­a­tions are sup­posed to be tense, there is a sense of bore­dom and pre­dictabil­ity. I feel sad that this is yet again, another dis­ap­point­ing dystopian Young Adult novel that will join its sis­ters in the Mediocre Hall of I Can’t Be Stuffed.But, if you do decide to visit, at least you get a free shirt!One last thingThis review also appears on my blog, ."
13,1,"I always wonder about raindrops.I wonder about how they’re always falling down, tripping over their own feet, breaking their legs and forgetting their parachutes as they tumble right out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It’s like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn’t seem to care where the contents fall, doesn’t seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors.Let me translate what Mafi was trying to say; ""It was raining.""of ; she tries too hard to be clever and poetic and the story gets muddied along the way.I apologize for not going more in depth with this review, but I read this book over three months ago now and all I remember is that I think my status updates should show this pretty clearly, but to make this easier to see, I've decided to write this somewhat brief review and sort through a few of my updates as well.A device Mafi chooses to use early on is striking out the words that ""crazy"" Juliette is ""really"" thinking. As the story goes on this device gets used less and less and so it feels more like Mafi just used it in the beginning for fun and to make her book look different from the rest of the young adult books out there, which, unfortunately, it is NOT, especially when you get to the romance. And that is what this story is: , and a disgustingly sappy one at that.I don't think you'll be able to believe these until you read them for yourself:""I'd like to cry into his eyes.""""His body presses closer and I realize I'm paying attention to nothing but the dandelions blowing wishes in my lungs.""""I'm suddenly desperate to drink in every drop of his being, desperate to savor every moment I've never known before. I suddenly worry that there's an expiration date on this phenomenon.The possibility of losing himThe possibility of losing himThe possibility of losing him is 100 years of solitude I don't want to imagine.Realization is a pendulum the size of the moon. It won't stop slamming into me.""""His heart is racing so fast I can't distinguish it from my own. It's 5,000 degrees in the air between us.""""I've run out of words. My pockets are full of letters I can't string together.""""I want to fall asleep to the sound of his heart beating in the atmosphere.""""His eyes are a midnight moment filled with memories, the only windows into my world.""""My heart fails for a moment.There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe.""""James and Adam glance back at me and I melt into pink Play-Doh.""""I'm up.Spinning.Scanning.Scared.They found us is the only thing I can think of. My stomach is a flimsy crepe, my heart a raging woodpecker, my blood a river of anxiety.""""It's raining today. The sky is weeping for us.""""His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.""""The sun is revolving around the moon when he responds.""""I offer him a smile. Try to keep my organs from falling out. Hope the holes in my head aren't showing.""""My mouth is sitting on my kneecaps.""""My neck snaps up to meet his dark eyes, his smooth voice, silky and strong.""""My jaw is dangling from my shoelace.""""I'm blushing through my bones.""""Adam pulls back just a tiny bit. Kisses my bottom lip. Bites it for just a second. His skin is 100 degrees hotter than it was a moment ago. His lips are pressed against my neck and my hands are on a journey down his upper body and I'm wondering why there are so many freight trains in my heart, why his chest is a broken harmonica.""And that, my friends, is that. Even if I didn't think the writing was trite and overwrought, later on it really starts to feel like she's borrowing heavily from the X-Men mythos (even though she claims she's never even seen the movies.) If you read the few quotes I've listed above and they're not your cup of tea, I'd say skip this one and try something else. Or maybe watch one of the X-Men movies instead; you'll get a much better portrayal of Rogue and a steamier love story. Mmm ... Wolverine."
14,2,"So, I actually didn't hate this as much as I thought I would. I enjoyed maybe thirty percent of it before it all went downhill, but... um... it really went downhill.I do not like to think about eyeballs. They just exist. I don't want to look at them. I hate this cover.But that's irrelevant. The hideous covers are irrelevant. But... is that Adam's eye? Because the only thing I took from this is that Adam's eyes are blue blue blue cobalt blossoming bruise clear as the midnight sky blue.*aggressive coughing*Ma'am, this is a Wendy's.I actually didn't mind the writing, as long as it wasn't about Adam's eyes. The biggest complaint I see is usually related to the purple prose and long-winded metaphors and awkward phrases, but I enjoyed it...? To a point. I thought most of the strange metaphors were accurate, and the somewhat unconventional style of writing really helped to portray Juliette's trauma, which was my favorite part of the book. Too bad it all disappeared when she ✨fell in love.✨ Because that's just how the world works.I did find some, uh, interesting quotes:And one of those hands is mine.It's like... here, I'll write an example.Here's a normal sentence:""I walk down the cold hall.""Now make it as awkward as possible:""I walk down the hall, the linoleum as cold as the corpses of the women and children they've killed, and my spine conducts enough electricity to power an entire city.""I didn't love her, but I liked the portrayal of trauma even though it suddenly disappeared halfway through. She needs to stop thinking in strikethroughs, but I don't have any real complaints. She's frustratingly stubborn at times, but she's a YA protagonist, obviously she's going to be stupid.Juliette can torture/kill people with her touch. She was locked away at a young age and has lived in solitary confinement ever since. She's a little kooky. I don't really care.Are you serious? I have to choose between an obsessed problematic psycho serial killer love interest and a blander-than-bland cardboard cutout organic whole wheat waffle love interest??Adam is the organic whole wheat waffle. He's probably better for Juliette than the psycho serial killer, but apparently he's not the endgame LI.To summarize his character development, he went from a somewhat interesting mysterious weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend to... a very bland concerning weirdo and Juliette's third grade friend.This is instalove disguised as we-were-friends-as-kiddos-and-now-I-love-you. Which is probably worse. Adam's entire backstory is that he was hit as a kid once (this was never mentioned again) and he's spent his entire life searching for Juliette. Because logic.I wouldn't have minded the abuse subplot if it were actually a subplot instead of something mentioned once and thrown away. Maybe if it, I don't know, actually affected him, I would call it deep and move on.I was okay with him until he and Juliette had a little dialogue sequence. He tried to give her a blanket (this was before he knew that she had magical killing powers) and she told him not to touch her, but he was being all rebellious and she said it again, and then she said this, to which he replied:When someone tells you not to touch them, you back off. It's basic courtesy and respect. Don't assume it's about you.Warner is the obsessed problematic psycho serial killer. In case you were wondering.Some of my friends have been telling me Juliwarner is a better ship than Julikent. I beg to differ. Adam may be an organic whole wheat waffle, but at least he's not an edgy guy with problems that could be solved by therapy but he's too tough for therapy so there's that. Ahem.He's, uh, strangely obsessed with Juliette and continually tries to make advances on her even after she shows no interest in him. First of all, he needs to stop. Second of all, he's blond?? That was random, but since when are villains blond? I was picturing him with black hair until I searched up fanart to see what Juliette looked like and Warner was there with his blond hair. This is not okay.What worldbuilding? All I know is that there's something called The Reestablishment, which is a dystopian government that does bad stuff. What bad stuff? Who knows? And apparently the planet is all desolate now because the sky is gray. *looks outside* Oh no, the sky is gray. We must be living in a post-apocalyptic world because obviously clouds aren't a thing.I didn't hate it, but I certainly didn't like it.2 stars, get that cover away from me before I actually throw up"

17,1,"This book is pretty darn bad. This book is pretty darn bad.Oh, darn, did I miss the point of the strikethroughs?"
18,1,"Instagram || Twitter || Facebook || Amazon || PinterestIt's not easy being Queen of Literary Trash. Between YA and bodice-rippers, I read more ""bad"" books than most elitist snobs will see in their entire lifetime. But then, I consider myself a connoisseur of the so-called trashy arts. There are two kinds of ""bad"" books. There are the books that tell good stories and while they aren't highbrow literature, they are still fun to read and if you can let go of your snobbery long enough to enjoy them, will perform quite serviceably as quality entertainment. Then there are the books that are just bad, and have no redeeming value at all.I had friends warn me about SHATTER ME. It's apparently infamous for the ""creative"" metaphors that the author likes to use. It's also yet another attempt to cling to the coattails of THE HUNGER GAMES (although it's more like DIVERGENT than THE HUNGER GAMES, which if you know my thoughts on DIVERGENT, you will know is not a compliment, coming from me). The premise is pretty undeveloped. Juliette has been in captivity for just under a year when she accidentally killed a boy by touching him. Her touch, you see, is deadly. She's like Rogue, from X-men. One touch, and your life force is hers.It's set on a dying Earth but why and how it's dying are incredibly vague. We've apparently allowed a fascist-tolerant (if not outright fascist) regime to gain power, which I say is not really giving the world a whole lot of credit, but on the other hand I'm a liberal living in the United States right now, so on the OTHER hand, maybe future Earth is totally stupid enough to do that. It seems to happen a lot in YA dystopians, to the point where the reader begins to wonder if all it takes to start a fascist regime is a kickstarter and a special license. What matters is that resources are thin and there is not a lot of food and there are parts of the world that are radioactive(?) and for some reason, some people (especially Juliette) have mutant-like powers for Reasons and this is the world we live in.Both love interests are, conveniently, immune to Juliette's power. Because I guess it wouldn't be much of a romance if the book took the MC Hammer ""Can't Touch This"" approach to courtship. There is instalove up the wazoo in here, and even when Juliette finds out that Adam was put in her cell to spy on her under the guise of being a fellow prisoner, she forgives him stunningly quickly, and is constantly telling us how much she wants to touch him. She wants to touch the villain, Warner (I'm sorry but I can't take you seriously when I'm picturing the dancing frog mascot of the WB), too, although it's a traitorous body sort of desire to touch, the I-love-to-hate-how-I-hate-to-love-you type. Warner was the biggest potential sell of this series to me because I love villainous love interests but he's too creepy, even for me. Between the constant unwanted pet names and the really disturbing ""I could just take a bite out of you""-type comments, this dude was about one villain notch away from singing a Tim Curry songThen there's the writing itself, which can be broken down into three categories: OMG, WTF, and LOL.OMG:(68).(163).(310).WTF:(6).(40).(172).(326).LOL:(151).(286).The author also makes two other attempts at being creative, which are overuse of the strikethrough tool and overuse of numbers, written as numerals instead of being spelled out. Which, if you ask me, is 1 bad idea because not only does it look unprofessional as 0 other writers do this, but 2, comes across as overly gimmicky and makes you feel like you're reading cast-offs from a teenager's poetry journal as she tries - and fails - to channel Ellen Hopkins and/or Rupi Kaur.If you like this book, good for you, I guess. I personally couldn't stand it. It felt incredibly derivative, and from the woe-is-me beginning to the yay-I've-got-a-hypersexualized-supersuit ending, there was just way too much I ended up side-eying in this book for me to enjoy it. I don't think I'll be reading the sequels, not even for the lols.1 star"
19,4,You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!This was something...and I liked it.
20,4,"I seriously don’t know why it took me so long to dig my claws into this book, but I definitely know that I don’t regret doing it! ;-)“Shatter Me” was an awesome read and I enjoyed it immensely! There were so many things I loved about this book and whilst it is true that many people complained about the writing style, I have to admit that I actually loved it.I think it was something new and extraordinary and I loved the way Juliette described her world. The repetitions, her thoughts, the things she thought and even the truths she vehemently refused to admit. It all gave me a very good picture of her character and her mind, the many things she must have gone through shaping her into a person that distrusts everyone and desperately tries not to feel anything. XD Of course she’s failing but this actually only made her even more likeable. *lol*See where I’m getting at? Tahereh Mafi knows exactly what she’s doing and she really managed to drag me into her world. Yes, I confess! I’m officially hooked now and I’m soo going to read all of the other books! ;-PSo be prepared to read many reviews! *LOL*Okay, enough of the threats and right back to the characters! Oh, the characters! There’s so much to tell! XDAt the beginning of the book you don’t even know her name. Everything you know is that she’s been imprisoned for ages and that she’s more than just a little insecure. Considering her ability this is no surprise though, the fact she can hurt and even kill people with just the touch of her fingertips making it kind of hard to be all too sociable. Juliette may not talk a lot but she sees everything and she’s more than just observant. She obviously also seems to have a knack for poetry and I really enjoyed the way she used her words.That boy is hot as hell and Juliette’s new cell mate! Could a girl ask for more? Dark hair, blue eyes, awesome and muscular body! *drools* Okay, okay! I’m back on track! *lol* Yeah, as you can see Adam is just awesome boyfriend material and it’s no wonder that they kind of hit it off! He’s caring and gentle and he always tries to understand Juliette’s thoughts. I liked him from the beginning and I’m really curious to find out how things are going to proceed in the next books. =)Sidenote: Is it just me or does he never tell Juliette that he loves her? O_o I thought this was kind of odd. Juliette told him she loved him but as far as I could read he never returned it…. Did I miss anything? xDOh my god! Warner! Gosh! Warner! Argh! Warner! *babbling mess* That boy, that boy gave me all the feels! Good and bad! Happy and angry! Disgusted and longing for more! *lol* I wanted him to touch Juliette and I wanted her to touch him! I just couldn’t decide if I wanted it because I wanted him to hurt or because I wanted them to make out! *LOL* What is it with me and the villains? Why do I love them so much!? XD First Maven and now Warner, I think I’m going to die! >_< Oh, well I think I’m supposed to say something about his character as well so here I go: He’s ruthless when he is with his soldiers but he is gentle whenever he is with Juliette. He seems to care about her a LOT and he even admitted that he loved her! But why does he hurt her so much? Warner is a big question mark and some sort of mystery I’m determined to solve. So yesh, I’m so going to read “Destroy Me” after I wrote this review! XDI loved Kenji! That boy is so funny and I really enjoyed his sassy demeanour. He’s constantly hitting on Juliette and his character gives the book a hilarious edge. I want more of him and actually can’t wait to meet him again! =)So, if you haven’t already figured it out:YES I liked “Shatter Me” and I can easily recommend it to anyone who’s looking for a nice and short-lived page turner! =)Enjoy! ;-P"
21,2,I’m unhauling this whole series and canceled my preorder of the new book. I’m changing my views and cleaning house. Sucks these books look damn good on the bookshelf though!! I will always love Warner though.Picture by George RedhawkMel 🖤🐶🐺🐾
22,5,"By the way, check out this fan made poster for the movie, if there ever was one.Made by on deviantART.I looove it! Exactly how I would picture a movie poster for this book._________________I read this book in one sitting.For five hours, I read this. It was a school night and I stayed up all night. That's how much this book pulled me.I know that there are many people who didn't like this book, some even it, but... Gah, it was just so awesome to me! It's definitely one of those books that pulled me in and refused to let go. I loved every minute of it, and I guess I see why it's getting all the hate─insta-love, lack of world-building, the writing style, etc etc─but... I don't know, something about this book just really really wowed me, and it was fucking awesome in my eyes.Also, the author herself is awesome as well. <3 where you can see all of her adorableness. :DOverall, in spite of all the hate this book is getting, I absolutely loved it, and can't wait for the sequel."
23,2,"(2.5?) The lack of world building is one of my main issues with this book (even though it seems like things will be explained in book 2... a full book with little world building is boring!).I didn't love the writing and the characters felt very one dimensional.Kinda felt like another YA dystopian world with a love triangle and an incredibly pretty main character - even after spending over 6 months isolated, underfed... and the fact that she hasn't seen herself in the mirror in 3 years... Her beauty is mentioned in pretty awkward moments.If it wasn't for the fact that people say the series becomes way better after book 1 I would stop but I'll give the second book a try!"
24,2,It's been 27 hours since I started reading this book.1620 minutes since I invited my doom.97200 seconds since my brain cells started disintegrating dyingdyingdyingdyingDead. They are dead.I couldn't do anything to help them.I'm pathetic weak stupid dumb idiot.
25,1,"dnf @ p. 127.Yeah, well, you know how is this.15 y/o me would have loved this book, she would. You know, I'll create a new shelf specifically for old YA books of 2012 that back in then I'd have probably loved, or at least liked, to put in there this kind of disappointments, ok? I need name suggestions because my last braincell just died trying to finish this book.So, we have Juliette, a girl who can kill or torture people with her touch. She killed someone before and for that, she was sent to an asylum. She has a new cell partner, Juliette hasn't touched anybody in 3 years, or talked with somebody in that time. And she thinks she knows her partner: a guy named Adam. And, oh, she does: he was her classmate in third grade, but he doesn't remember her.In within a couple weeks, Juliette falls for Adam. She recognizes her blue eyes, and she describes them in several ways that made me realize that that kind of blue is now tattooed on my brain. Suddenly, some armed guys take Juliette and Adam out of the asylum and take them to a thing called The Reestablishment, that took everything from her, yada, yada, yada.And turns out that, oh wow!, Adam is a soldier and lied to her (in what? idk, y'all, because he didn't talk to her a lot in those two weeks), and betrayed her (betrayed you how? You two only met for a couple of weeks and you barely talked to him). Now, this new guy appears: Warner. He wants Juliette on his team for torture rebels and that shit :DThe writing was ok? I guess? I don't know, man. Some metaphors were cool, but others were exaggerated. The pacing was ok for a YA dystopian book, idk, the metaphors were taking away everything logical here. I mean, it wasn't bad to hate it, but I was getting confused sometimes. For me, a Spanish native speaker, the pacing, the writing and the level of English was cool and understandable.But, the famous but, the thing with the numbers got me spending more braincells that I can usually afford. There's a reason why I'm a lit student and I quit math and numbers a long time ago. I also noted that there's a lot of and words repeated 3 times times times, which got me confused, and tired.Uhm, this sucked. Juliette only described two places. The asylum (and barely, bc she only described her cell) and the famous Reestablishment, but even like that, it wasn't described at all. It was poor. The sky is grey, but, isn't like that when it's rainy?Here: a pic of grey sky that I took of the back of my house, lmao. Please, ignore the bad quality that GR added to it.I must admit that Juliette's trauma was well protrayed, it was ok and tolerable. But then.... she fell in love. Sometimes, I get upset and pissed off because she was annoying as hell. But, I don't blame her or the author: that book was written back in 2011 I guess, so, it was normal that female MC's in those books were annoying to the point that you wanted to throw them a shoe. Also, hun, you should have killed Warner when he asked you to touch him. Get rid of that asshole. EVEN IF I KNOW THAT THEY'RE ENDGAME, LMAO.Also, Juliette says in a part: hOW, ON EARTH, ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT????Adam is so bland and boring. And oh, plot twist, he does remember Juliette. Oh, wow, you didn't see that coming? (As a hard Pietro Maximoff fan, that line hurts bad, please, don't touch me). And he wants to run away with her. He wasn't interesting at all. He was the only nice kid with Juliette, but they never talked, lmao.The famous Aaron Warner. Well, what do you want me to say? He's a fucking dick. Those 4 words resume my feelings toward him. I hate whenever he calls Juliette just hit him with a rock. And the only smart braincell of Juliette finally says something logical.Finally, some guts.Warner is a psycho killer with daddy issues and feels like he's some sorta god or what I know, but he's just an annoying ass who should ✨fuck✨off✨. Juliette asks him why he's being nice to her... Honey, he's not. He just wants something from you: your power. Have a little bit of self love. He's also a stalker and a creepy guy.Yes, Warner, ✨fuck✨you✨.Juliette saying that she wants to crush Warner's spine is a GREAT MOOD.People kept saying to me that I was going to love him on the novella about him, but if I dnf this book, I'd hardly read the next ones, or the novellas.My big ass question for the Warner fans are: how can you love him? He's a dick 90% of the time and a psycho the other 10%. Does he get over his daddy issues and goes to therapy? Because if he does, that would be a very good first step.The only nice quote that I liked it was this:Look, if you liked Shatter me book and series, it's fine. I'm actually glad that people enjoyed this while I was trying to figure it out if the problem is not me or what. If you also loved Warner, it's ok, I get it. Perhaps he changes and become something good. For those who liked, loved and enjoyed Shatter me: I admire you because it's something that seems pretty far away from me, impossible is more accurate.I should stop reading hyped books of 2012 because they're not for me anymore. Once more, back in that year, I'd loved them, but now, I feel really old to read 2012 dystopian YA books with annoying MC's and really weird love interests.Cool, I wanna throw one at her.Yeah, sorry not sorry, guys.See ya in the next chapter of big hype big lie. Stay tuned."
26,2,"~ 2 stars ~This is the most painfully underwhelming and mediocre book I have ever read in my life. If Juliette and Adam make out ONE more time, I might have to drench myself with gasoline and light myself on fire. I've read worse books. But that's not a compliment.• This book basically sidelined every important thing in this book for the romance. The romance with such an uninteresting person, that it's actually funny. They are literaly running for their lives, but somehow have time to be all lovey-dovey. There was scarcely any world-development, nor anything of substance. Like please, if you asked me what this book is about, I couldn't answer you.• He is so bland. Someone under one of my updates said he was as bland as white bread () and dry bread (). I liked both comparisons and very much accurate. I can't believe that he's so unamusing, that I want to know more about Warner Bros™, than him. Someone give this man a personality. Some spice. Please. Having blue eyes is not a personality trait.• I don't see how he can have such drastic character development. He's possessive, arrogant, and is everything I typically dislike. But at the very least, because everyone loves him, I'll grudgingly keep an open mind. Another comparison was him to soggy bread () and yes.• I don't really like her either. She had moments that I liked, but all the potential she could have had, was wasted on the romance making her seem like a love-sick child. Stop with all the touching. That's all she talks about. She just obsesses over Adam. She literally threw herself at the first man that gave her an ounce of attention and respect.• That ending was terrible. It didn't even feel like it ended. The epilogue was the same scene as the last chapter, and it added nothing. I don't feel like I read a full book, it seems like half a book.• it was so out of hand. It didn't make sense, and without it, I would have really liked Mafi's writing style. Not to mention the fact that some of the dialogue was absolute cringe.Here are some examples:• The eye color descriptions drove me crazy. Will Herondale has some tough competition. I don't understand the obsession. And they were shoved down my throat approximately every 5 pages or so as if it was relevant.Those were the main things I had an issue with, but there are definitely more. The only thing that made this digestible were the short chapters and pace. Overall, I don't think I can recommend, but so many people love this book, it just wasn't for me. But I will be continuing with the series for the sake of curiosity."
27,5,I WANT WARNER SO BAD ITS NOT EVEN FUNNY
28,1,"usually I am nostalgic and like to look back on the past to see how much I’ve grown, but this review was just..... so embarrassing. I want to sink in a hole every time I get a notification that someone liked this in 2020. so! I would like to keep just these two lines from 2017:- my first reaction when I finished the book was: thank god it’s over- “He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter.”—Jupiter is not small... Jupiter is the largest planet in our solar system......"
29,3,"“All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”The story unfolds slowly and is narrated in the first person by Juliette.Initially, I was confused because there were so many strikings and Juliette's obsession with numbers was something that potentially annoyed me and I didn't quite understand why it was written that way. It was only later that I realized that all of it was hinting at Juliette's state of mind, and in that aspect, it was a job well done because I didn't for a second feel like I was reading a book, it was more of reading Juliette's thoughts, getting to know more of her character, her opinions about the world, her parentage and her past as if she herself was conversing with me. I was thoroughly invested in the story, awaiting with curiosity what would happen next.The story opens in a room with one window, four walls, and 144 square feet. Juliette is left alone, without a human being anywhere near her for about 264 days, and the reason? She has been cursed with a touch so lethal that she doesn't trust her own self around any other human entity. Later, a man who goes by the name is sent into her room and she remembers that she has known him since he was a schoolboy and that she could never forget his blue eyes. She refuses to speak to him and silently scribbles in her notebook when one day, another man, supposedly the leader of Sector 45 takes her as a prisoner (more or less), and the series of events that follow changes her life.The characters are beautifully portrayed and Warner and Kenji had my heart from the beginning. I knew something about Warner was off, that he may not be the monster he was portrayed to be or that there's a solid reason behind why he is the way he is, and it only made me root for him.I don't have many thoughts about Adam. Kenji is truly one of a kind. When everyone is serious about the apprehensions of what's about to happen, he had his own ways to lighten the mood, be it with his flirtations with Juliette or swearing all the way, and successfully managed to make me smile.The story was well-paced with equal emphasis on the characters and the plot surrounding them.A story about a girl with a magical yet lethal touch. The incinerating culture of The Reestablishment. A tale that stands out despite its cratering imperfections."
30,3,"MKAY. First of all. I actually liked this but I must rant.. I must... then I promise to go to book 2 immediately.WHY. WHYWHYWHYWHY.No, it was not just the strikeouts and crazy reputations. It wasn’t even the unfinished sentences.Please please please explain to me how you come up with sentences like this…orUm. Okay?I swear this book was littered with those.. I don’t even know what to call them… on every single page. I’m really sorry but I just needed to rant about that. Why Mrs. Mafi.. WHY.So OK. Ugh whatever. I’m not ashamed. Maybe I am. Whatever. It wasn’t the most original story ever and it certainly had its very…odd… parts… but I’m totally curious about book two and I’ll definitely be continuing. Maybe because the promise of something more from friends? Who knows. I can’t help it… I got into it. (Harriet, girlfriend.. thanks for being there for me.)As I continued powering through...I found that I never got less annoyed with the writing I just started skipping the unnecessary sentences… thus the book was a little more enjoyable.***************This is where I’m going to get so stop here if you haven’t read this book…I feel very meh about her. I mean I feel for her- I do, but I’m waiting to see what she’s made of.Yeah, yeah. Ok. I’m sad for him. I like him. The whole taking are of your family, living through abuse— I feel you bro, I feel you. Thats some tough crap.…. well alright. I don’t know if its because of all the crazy fandoms over this guy but I’m interested. Clearly we haven’t the foggiest on whats going on in his little brain. Right now he seems like an over obsessed lunatic… but who knows.- Congrats dude. You’ve won my favorite character for this book award. (This dude is basically Jax’s close (from the Air Awakens series.) Lets call you Mr. Personality.Don’t hate me guys but I have some issues with this. YES there are feels… and I would have totally been on board for them EXCEPT FOR THE FACT that how can you be so focused on lust when you both are literally fighting/running for your life?? I’m sorry, but making out is the last thing that should be on your mind if you are trying to keep each other alive. Ughhh Tamlin much? Like you guys were apart for years and you never talked to each other in the first place (AND YES THAT BUILD UP WAS SWEET… I genuinely appreciated their connection..) but come on - talk first! Survive first! Chill your dills.Whatever, I know what happens to them in book 2.So this was really only mildly developed- we’re only told bits and pieces. Honestly this didn’t bother me though- I’m typically much more interested in the characters. It feels like a fairy generic dystopian world but whatever. I anticipate much more from this in book 2.Okay but really WTF is with elastic boy?? Da fuck?So despite my little rants... WHATEVER OK..~"
31,5,throwback to when i read this book and was Team Adam
32,5,"[image error]How awesome was this book? Well,I am going to tell you. Pretty darn awesome!I am not very good at convincing people to read the books I loved so I am going to write this review without any pressure.1. if you are (like myself) a fan of X-Men,you will love it,...2. If you are (like myself) a fan of strong and smart leading character like Juliet,you will love it.3. If you are (like myself) a fan of totally shagable and caring guy like Adam,you will love it.4. If you are (like myself) a fan of crazy and demented bad guy who actually happens to be smoking hot(and in love with our girl Juliet),you will love it.5. If you are (like myself) a fan of almost kissing or almost doing it scenes,then you will love it.If that wasn't enough for you,than you suck.I love the guys in this book. Adam has tattoos and muscles but Warner is also hot in a I-will-kill-you kind of way. He reminds me of hotter and more dangerous version of Tom Felton . I mean look at thisIs it getting hot in here,or is it just me?"
33,4,"pretty sure my most extreme opinion is: adam is, and always will be, better than warner.never have i felt so strongly about something and i will defend him until my last breath. hes perfect.feels good to get that off my chest. lol."
34,1,"Didn't finish. I simply stopped reading this book today, and it wasn't because it was boring or anything like that. I just did not care for Mafi's writing style. The over use of metaphors and strikeout tools caused a constant distraction, and the book was just not interesting enough for me to want to struggle through something that annoyed me so much.The book (well what I got to, anyway) read like a super annoying IM by a 12 year old girl that just learned what a metaphor is. Do we REALLY need 50 to 100 different ways to describe his eyes? She repeats things so many times as well, and it's like she used a bunch of tools that could have been great devices had she used them once or twice. Instead she chose to beat the metaphors, strikeouts, and repetitions into your head so many times you just end up wanting to stop reading.This book was one of the biggest disappointments of 2011 for me, and I still cannot understand why anyone would enjoy this book, let alone say this author has talent. When I read the synopsis, I thought this book sounded so good. This could have been an amazing story, but sadly the execution was horrible."
35,4,"This is gooooooooood.I'm not giving it 5 stars because, even if I admire the shit out of the author's style and talent, the writing is a bit too pretentious at times (hyperbole thy name is Tahereh Mafi), and I really don't care much about the whole Adam/Juliette thing, which unfortunately, occupies a huge part of the story.If you know me, you know I am a pro at ignoring ships that the authors clearly want you to root for.I don't trust Adam and his and Juliette's feelings for each other are so desperate and all over the place that it's really easy to confuse love with a typical hormonal storm.Also, Adam is super boring, and this seems like one of those romances you often encounter in first books and which only purpose is to prepare you for the abominable love triangle that's inevitably going to be rubbed in your face, later.As if the presence of a love triangle wasn't a problem of its own already...But I'll try to endure it, for the sake of a good book such as this one.Just give me a bit more consensual interactions with Warner -because of course I had to fall for the stunning and stunningly cold-blooded sociopath-, fill up some plot holes, bless us all with some more Kenji sass, let Juliette not become a self-centered and stubborn bish, and I'm sold for the rest of the series.Can't wait to read book 2!"

37,0,"Warner who? Step aside and make way for my man Kenji Kishimoto!I cast Charles Melton⋆ ⋆ ⋆ ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ ⋆ ⋆ ⋆I finally did it!! 🤫 So, I secretly started reading this and I am 30% in…❝"
38,3,"firstly and foremostly, let us all agree on one thing:KENJI IS AMAZING.KENJI IS THE BEST.KENJI IS THE MOST HILARIOUSLY SARCASTIC CHARACTER I’VE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO MAKE THE ACQUAINTANCE OF.*gasps in more oxygen*KENJI IS STUNNING.KENJI DESERVES BETTER.i know i’m nearly a decade late to the hype, but #KENJISUPREMACYFOREVER OK YES.*collapses exhaustedly onto much-squashed pillow*let’s get started.first off, important note: at the time of writing this, I’ve read all three books of the first Shatter Me trilogy (Shatter Me, Unravel Me, and Ignite Me). Thusly, everything I wrote down here is stuff I was thinking at the time, combined with my omniscient future-Isabelle perspective.It’s worth noting as well that my ratings for all three books have steadily increased, from three stars for this book, to four stars for the second book, and finally to five stars for the last book.so basically what I’m trying to say: even if you didn’t like the first book, PLEASE KEEP READING. THERE IS HOPE.and Warner isn’t such a jerk in the later books. Ms. Mafi 100% turns it around.*another very obvious wink*ok ok i will now be talking about the plot before i spill all the secrets about the characters alright *cough*Juliette Ferrars of Sector 45 has been locked up for exactly 264 days. 264 days in an insane asylum without even catching a glimpse of another human. Certainly without touching another person.Why?Because contact with Juliette's skin is fatal.She found out at the age of fourteen, when she accidentally killed a little boy she was trying to help get up. Juilette was quickly declared a demon. Her parents grew to hate her. Her mother made Juliette stick her fingers in fire on her sixth birthday, just to prove her skin burned like everyone else’s. Her friends and peers abandoned her. Doctors told her she’d have to be contained for the people’s safety.Thus the 264 days in the insane asylum.However, on Day 265, something different occurs. Juliette’s given a cellmate, a supposed reward for good behavior.This new cellmate says his name’s Adam.Adam Kent.Adam tells Juliette stories of the world outside. The cardboard houses, the lack of vegetation, the dying wildlife.A few weeks later, the commander of Sector 45 demands Juliette’s release. The infamously ruthless commander, known only by his surname Warner, says he needs Juliette to be a weapon. A human weapon of mass destruction.Both men offer vastly different futures to Juliette.Juliette now has to not only pull her shattered pieces back together, but she must also make a choice: the exhilarating chance to reach her full potential, or the chance to work together to save them all.but what does each entail, and who is offering which?AAAAND if you’ve read at least the first three books you know that’s a very difficult, loaded question ;)The storyline itself was nothing particularly mind-blowing, but it had two things that separated it from your average YA:the writing was absolutely ridiculous.the plot was ridiculously addictive.I won’t say a lot about the writing, mainly since thousands of other reviewers have expounded on how flowery (and just plain weird) it is, but it was actually only an annoyance at worst and a guilty pleasure at best.THE CROSSED OUT WORDS WERE ANNOYING AS HECK THO like i know they go away after the first half, but STILL.The plot starts a tad slow, but becomes 100% GUILTILY ADDICTIVE AND I UNASHAMEDLY LOVED IT.NO I WILL NOT DISOWN SAID OPINION ✋OK THE CHARACTERS EEK.The supporting characters are half-and-half. Exactly half are flat and stupid, and the other half are GORGOUSLY AMAZING. I have too few available brain cells to talk about the flat and stupid, so we are going to skip that category. However, this second category is very important: this is where we are going to gush over Kenji.KENJI.KENJI.KENJI.KENJI.I LOVE YOU KENJIIIIHe’s sarcastic, he’s hilarious, he’s an incredible leader, he’s popular, and he’s bloody the only character with a sense of humor. What literally is not to like. I could read a book just about Kenji’s favorite prank and live happily ever after.*sigh*Now, I understand you have to see/read this man to properly believe him, so I’m going to shut up about Kenji now and talk about our MCs.The three main characters are Juliette, Adam, and Warner.Juliette Ferrars.I know a lot of people have complained about Juliette, but for what she went through, that girl has every reason to be a tad crazed and definitely socially challenged.Let us look at this from a real-life medical perspective: Juliette has almost never touched another human because any contact with her skin longer than about ten seconds kills said other human. According to Web MD, if we as humans don’t have enough touch with other humans, we can become more stressed, anxious, and depressed. Without positive experiences with touching others, we struggle making emotional connections with other humans. The article even says “long-term touch deprivation can even trigger post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).""and Juliette has all of those.so THERE juliette haters *grins satisfiedly*In this book, Juliette’s personal character arc is learning to live in the real world. In Unravel Me, she learns to find her own identity and her own life outside of others, but that’s a story for a different review. Here, Juliette is taking baby steps. Trust me. She gets so much stronger and more authoritative ;)Next, Warner. (no, i will definitely not be telling you what his first name is *wink wink*)When I read Shatter Me, I did not see any appeal in Warner whatsoever.HOWEVER.A little after reading Unravel Me (#2) and DEFINITELY after reading Ignite Me (#3), Warner has made me fall hopelessly in love with him. I know. If all you read is this book, it’s impossible to understand how on earth millions have fallen for this man.Trust me again. It will make sense later ;) ❤️and last and most certainly least, Adam Kent.Just ew. In this book he’s ew, and the other books he’s ew. He gets more ew as the trilogy goes on. Ew.We don’t stan a non-supportive and overprotective “boyfriend” 🙄🙄Goodbye and good riddance to you, Kent boy.ALRIGHT THAT’S IT. THAT’S ALL I GOT.I want to say so much more, but just go read Shatter Me. Even if you don’t like the first one, do keep reading. It gets so so much better. I liked each book better than the one before it.lol trust me for like the third time ok, i need more people to fangirl over Ignite Me (#3) with :))My reviews on Goodreads for the first Shatter Me trilogy:Ratings:Star Rating: ★★★☆☆If This Book Was a Movie Rating: PG-13Recommendations If You Liked This Book:Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo"
39,3,"CONSPIRACY THEORY: WE ALL FUCKING LOVE LOVE TRIANGLES!ps this is kind of spoilery sorryyeah i said it. here's why: this book was not good. the characters were so bland, the plot SO unoriginal, the writing... such a laughable attempt at poeticism. so the only explanation for why people like this HAS to be the love triangle. it was... SEXY ya know???adam, i mean WOW. a true STAND OUT and STAND UP guy. let's list the ways:- BOMB tats (i mean, cmon are u swooning yet????)- he LOVES her and can TOUCH her- he is most definitely NOT a creep who never sought contact with her when she was young and socially isolated but- i repeat:and omg... everybody loves a BAD BOI! WARNER![side note: anyone else keep picturing the pos from legally blonde]- CRYSTAL GREEN eyes- perfectly coiffed blonde hair and put together looks that are most not hitler youth-esque- he and can TOUCH her- he is most definitely NOT a stalker that found her medical records and planned an elaborate kidnapping scheme so he could use her for her ""skills""- he gives her fancy dressesbut it doesn't really matter. because at the end of the day, julia got her super suit. and who needs a man when you've got a fucking purple super suit.this concludes the sarcastic portion of the review.*******************************************ready to be shattered with &"
40,2,"(1.5/5)Buddy read with Layla, go check out her review!I went into this book with no expectations (negative expectations, really), and was somehow still disappointed. I think that's because this book has a somewhat promising premise and pitch, and an appealing cover, but simply fails to deliver.Shatter Me attempts to tell the story of Juliette Ferrars, a seventeen-year-old with speshul powers living in an apocalyptic world, with a corrupt government. .Despite the fact that this all sounds very classic YA dystopia so far, it still had the capacity to be decent. I mean, a dystopian story about Doesn't that sound at least somewhat interesting, even if it relies heavily on trite tropes and purple prose?Well, it did to me, and apparently, that's too high of a standard to keep with this book.I mean, to start us off, there's the main character, Juliette. While I liked the way that her trauma was depicted in the beginning, I felt very misled about what I was expecting from her. You see, a great many people told me that Juliette was super ""sarcastic"" and ""funny"". That her character arc was amazing. The only thing I found even vaguely funny about her was her usage of strike-throughs. .She’s bland af, her only defining character trait being that she has a ""curse"", and has suffered for it. She experiences no growth over the course of the story other than her all-consuming love for Adam, which, funny enough, also works to lessen the effects of her imprisonment?? I’m not even joking. The more time she spends with Adam, the less and repetition and repetition and c0unt1ng we see on the page. Yes, it is weird, and no, I do not have any good explanation.Speaking of which, we have Adam. The love interest. Compared to Adam, Juliette is like the epitome of personality and vibrance. I can tell you a hundred different things about Adam and they’re all about his eyes. The deep blue orbs. The shards of ice. The stormy skies. The troubled water. The list goes on and on and on. Tahereh Mafi has seemingly no end to the number of times she can describe his eyes, and I’m honestly concerned. Not to mention, he fills the role of another trope for the Recipe of YA Dystopias™: .The other third of the love triangle consists of Warner, the psychopath who’s irrevocably in love with Juliette. He is, of course, a part of the Corrupt Government™ aka ThE rEeStAbLiShMeNt. He, too, has many descriptions of his green eyes. Seriously. All of the descriptions of eyes need to stop.That being said, even though this book starts off with a pretty solid beginning, things start going downhill very quickly. Both Adam and Warner are introduced within the first 15% of this book, and the romance starts being """"""developed"""""" almost instantaneously. Of course, the progression of the romance between Juliette and Adam entails that they were childhood ""friends"" who never once spoke to each other. Oh, and they begin making out as soon as possible. Because, you know, #truelurrve!Now, this is the part where I confess that I’m a complete sucker for romantic plotlines. Usually, the case will be that I totally enjoyed a romance subplot in a book that most others believed they didn’t need. For the first time, I’m on the opposite team. However, as much as I wished that this love triangle didn’t exist, I’m afraid to say that it’s the only thing giving this book any substance. Without it, we quite literally would not have a book.you ask? Well, I’m also disappointed to say that . At least, not in the ways that count. It's a romance book with a dystopian sub-plot. Nothing at all happens until the last 20% of the book. Not to mention, the descriptions of the Earth, which is supposed to be completely ravaged from climate change include:- The land is gray.- There are no plants.- The sky is gray.- There are no birds.I don’t know about you, but that sounds like the description of a four-year-old’s drawing of the moon to me, not a war and disease-torn planet.The character development? Nonexistent.The writing? Filled with weird, nonsensical metaphors that I'm sure are supposed to mEaN sOmEtHiNg.So what kept me from condemning this book? Well, let’s just say, I’ve read things that are a lot worse. This book is actually alright. Amazing, even, compared to some of the dumpster fires I’ve read. Sure, maybe there are too many descriptions of frenzied make-out sessions, and ✨e y e s✨, but all things considered, this book was only slightly lower than where my expectations placed it.All in all, I completely flew through this book. Maybe because I read it in the middle of the night, and completely lost any sense of time, but most likely because the chapters are short to prevent prolonged suffering.~~~~~~~~~~~this was simultaneously better and worse than i expected it to be.rtc?~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~am i really adding this to my tbr?am i going to regret it later/hate it?"
41,1,Cannot stand the writing and the characters. Not sorry. Giving up the series. Not for me. Maybe I started it too late.
42,4,"“all i ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being, not just with my handsbut with my heart.”this book has been on my tbr forever and i finally caved in just for my psycho aaron warner 💓💗💞— i had mixed feelings starting this book bc the reviews were both good n bad so i was conflicted, but honestly iit, and i’m mad at myself for waiting so long to read this!!the writing style is different—it took me a while to get used to it, and the start of the book was slow and repetitive but i ended up enjoying it. (the writing style felt poetic to me)i am v grateful for the short chapters and how fast paced this book is >>>— i love kenji so fucking much!! he had me laughing and smiling with all his antics. i hope we see some character development w him in the next book— now , no wonder people didn’t like him in this book, he is literally borderline psychotic but he has the biggest soft spot for juliette!! some of the stuff he done was questionable, but i in fact could not hate him - now i can’t wait for his development throughout this series bc i know i’m going to be (already am) obsessed w him.when he calls juliette “love” and the way he cares abt her — he’s the definition of boy obsessed 😩😮‍💨😵‍💫💞💓💕this book left me with so many unanswered questions so i’m excited to see where this series goes and how it progresses"
43,4,4.5 ⭐️ i’m having a fabulous time.i feel this series taking over my life already.
44,2,"2.5 stars""No one has touched me in 264 days.""Look, guys, I knew the horror stories about Shatter Me. I read the reviews, saw the bloated quotes and everything. But I have a masochistic streak that stretches further than my common sense, so I read it.And... Like, it's . I remember marveling at how juvenile YA at the turn of the decade used to be, but it's not claw-my-eyes-out, why-the-fuck-was-I-given-the-ability-to-comprehend-words bad.at all. The flowery metaphors and strike-throughs complemented Juliette's fragmented state of mind quite well, and I can definitely see my literature class breaking down the blurred barrier between journal and reality. While it enforces my growing concern with the literary aesthetic of mental illness (Have you noticed that most books about it are written in flowery, romanticized prose?), it's readable and fascinating.I could complain about the cheesy landslide of romance, but honestly?Just look at that line. at it.I must have guffawed for at least ten minutes. The love triangle is so over-the-top and melodramatic, it's physically impossible to take seriously.Everything is spelled out for us like we're idiots. Or Ana Steele. Adam explains v-e-r-y clearly that Warner is broken and evil and that he wants Juliette to voluntarily choose him. Put up a big red sign that says Dangerous Love Interest, why don't you? Adam is the obligatory safe, boring choice that pounds his chest and makes possessive remarks.That scene where they're fighting over Juliette, man, trying to ""out-confess"" the other person. I still laugh when I think of it.It doesn't matter if she's malnourished and hasn't shaved her legs in 264 days. She's also pure and good and probably popped out of the Virgin Mary's untarnished vagina. Forgive me if I want a little complexity to my protagonists. You can create a ""good""character without making her a saint. Look at Harry Potter, Katniss Everdeen, or Inej from . Having Juliette backsass Warner isn't the same as letting her have realistic human emotions.Though nothing about Shatter Me is realistic. The romance sparks at the speed of a flash flood, which I could accept if it were the result of a mating bond like in High Fantasy, but not in a world that's an extension of ours. It's a caricature of... something, because it sure as hell isn't a dystopian. though apologists will pin that on Juliette's seclusion and lack of awareness. The story essentially revolves around people and since all the important people in Juliette's life are love interests, it's heavily, At least Twilight had the rest of the Cullen family and Bella's dad.But what the hell. It was entertaining.One last thing. He's framed as a love interest, which terrifies me even more. Pay attention to the way Juliette describes her interactions with him: ""Trapped"", ""Threatened"", ""Unable to move"". Someone should put a rape trigger warning on this book because his body language is dangerously accurate.Yeah, yeah, he's the villain, but he's also someone we're supposed to root for. There are ways to write antiheroes without descending to macho dominance. There are ways to portray Warner's desire for her without making him into every dick that deliberately trails after a woman in the dark, just to see her sweat.Food for thought."
45,5,The writing style took some getting used to but in the end I ended up loving this book.I loved the characters and especially loved how fully immersed I was in the story and Juliette's transformation as a character.
46,2,"---1.5 'insane monster' ☆---I present to you all the perfect book if your ever in the mood to want to read 300+ pages of a girl unnecessarily trying to convince you that she's not an insane monster and that she reeeealy needs someone to touch her touch her touch her with a bad writing style, ✨toxic✨ love interest, an unnecessary amount of metaphors and a dramatic amount of wanting to kiss someone at the most random and most possibly life threatening momentsI am not even over exaggerating this rn, let the quotes speak for themselves:♧(All of this just because a guy told the FMC he was looking for her 🙄)♧(I- not a rainbow 😭🤚)♧(😶)♧(i don't even have a problem with this, this was just too relatable for me not to add it in)♧(This is just one sentence, more than half of the book is like this 💀💀)♧(This pains me to even read rn)♧(I have no problem with this, this was just too funny not to add 😭🤚)The only character l was remotely  interested in was , whatever we got of him was enough to make me swoon over him 🤰✨💖😩🧎‍♀️💥Fomo brought me here. 🙂🔫I hope l don't go insane by the end of it 😭💀"
47,4,"Re-Read (11/02/2018)I enjoyed it as much as I thought I would. I missed the characters a lot so I spent a great time accompanying them in this adventure, I know that it is not the best book in the world and I know that alot of people can't stand it, but personally, even though I'm aware of certain problems in it, I can't stop loving it. Shatter Me is one of those books that have made me love reading even more and will always be in my heart. I can't wait to continue with my re-reading in preparation for Restore Me, which I hope doesn't breake my heart lol.Read about Kenji and Warner again, it makes me so happy!The plot is very interesting from the start, of course that highlights the incredible of the writing of this book, because guys, I've been in love with the way of writing that has Tahereh!. So beautiful, unique and completely addictive!if it has taken me a while to finish reading it, it was simply because I have no time to read (universal dilemma of most LOL), because this book is mainly characterized because, once you start with it is very difficult to leave it !. I had read it in one sitting if I could.is a great main character for the story, from the beginning won my heart, for the difficult things she has been through (for his ""condition""), how hard it has been her childhood and the relationship with her parents, just, broke my heart.There were moments in which I thought, ""Why you does this or Why you say that?"", I think she was a little lost in some pretty obvious situations to understand, from my point of view, but then you think she's been locked up for a while and has not had intimately contact with anyone in her life, and her actions have much more sense.is a character that I liked, but it took me a while to love him, I liked more in the end, in the action scenes, but for others things I consider him as the typical hero of the story, quite stereotype, handsome boy, who saves te girl and I don't know yet I'm not convinced about it. But I have faith on him, and I hope revelations for this character , maybe change my mind :)is my love lol, I feel a great connection with this character, it is dark and hides a mystery that catches my attention. It is so interesting and sexy , I'm dying to know more of its history, really, I know it is something perverse in this book but you can't deny that his scenes with Juliette are INCREDIBLE. High Voltage guys!,even when only they speak to each other. So Good! . I don't know how she resists to him!"
48,2,"Does anyone else have the problem where you read a book and your mind is stuck thinking like the writing style of that book?No? Just me?Because I've had that going on since elementary school. Reading books like the Junie B. Jones series was a fucking pain in the ass because of the grammar and the stupidity. I didn't like reading like that and I did not want to think like that.Well, that happened to me with this book too. And yes it's almost impossible to think in strikethroughs and yes the writing style of this book isn't absolute trash, but that came back to bite me in the ass. I did not want my brain to cross out a thought after I spilled my cup of tea. I did not want these weird run-on sentences about counting, which is something I do for no reason. And I did not want my thoughts to be filled with overmetaphorical descriptions of eyeballs.The only time I like thinking about eyeballs is when my contact lenses fall off of mine like they did this morning.Okay yes I'm done going on about this writing style. Basically, I liked reading it in a trashy way but I don't appreciate thinking like it at all. Nothing wrong with it except for how it stuck in my head.And then the . Juliette, basically, is a girl who lives in a newly-communist world where everything is dying. Oh, and she has the ability to kill people with a touch. And that makes her a monster. Because that's such an original plot idea.Juliette is, essentially, an insane girl whose only coping mechanism is to remind herself that she has ✨morals✨ and to remember that other people have ✨morals✨ and that's why she's been trapped in an asylum. Which is completely deteriorating her mental health because she hasn't left her room in [insert number of days here].Okay listen bitch, I'm an aspiring author. That means half my time is filled with plotting how I want to kill someone. And I'm also a person who's currently alive. That means I've spent almost a year either holed up in my house with two parents who drive me insane, or stuck in school with a mask over my face with other people who drive me insane.I still don't think, write or speak in strikethroughs and numbers and run-ons. Usually.Honestly that's not even the plot, that's just an introduction to Juliette's overdramatically oversensitive brain and her lack of other personality traits.What plot? The one where Juliette learns she has more ~powers~ and basically falls into an existential crisis because OH MY GOD SHE CAN STILL DESTROY STUFF.Then there was a love triangle with no actual love. The two were some of the worst characters I've seen.Adam was just a piece of cardboard with two big blue splotches on its head to represent the ~swirling oceanic depths of his deep deep deep blue eyes~. He can touch Juliette, so she falls in love with him. Also, he has ""cerulean whirlpools of blue surrounding his pupils that drag me down to the depths of some emotion that probably is unnatural"". That's not a direct quote, but yeah. Basically, his ~azure gemstones~ are his only personality trait.And then Warner. I don't give a fuck how sexy he is, or how nice he is to a dying dog, or how pretty his ~emerald lawns of green orbs~ are. He's creepy, he's insane, he's toxic, and he's abusive. He's obsessed with Juliette because her ability to kill stuff is gorgeous and oh she's a feral animal and it's so sexy. Warner is a problematic, disgusting creepy piece of trash.I was hoping for a good story of empowerment and a girl getting over her phobias and learning to accept herself.Instead, I got three pieces of cardboard with ✨special orbs✨ that tried to kill each other- the idea that powers exist in the future due to genetic mutations- Warner getting shot- the premise- when Adam didn't exist- Juliette figuring out that other stuff is real- how short it wasEverything else was so trashy. I did enjoy the book when I read it, and I originally gave it a four stars.But looking back on it, I don't know what I even liked. Seriously, Juliette has ✨a dream✨ of a bird. Because most birds are dead now. And Adam has *gasp* tattooed on his chest.Coincidence?Probably, since there was no other reason for that to exist other than so that Juliette could ~fall in love~.Trash, but good trash. Maybe worth a reread."

50,4,"Overall: 4/5 StarsCharacters: 4/5Setting: 4/5Writing: 5/5Plot and Themes: 4/5Awesomeness Factor: 4/5Review In A Nutshell:  Shatter Me is an amazing series, one of my absolute favorites! However, I think this book is best for people who are willing to devote some time to getting into the writing style and getting to know the characters.takes place in a dystopian future, where our protagonist, Juliette, has been locked away for 264 days. Why? Because she can kill people with her touch alone and has no control over this power. When the Reestablishment decides to use her as a weapon, Juliette must decide how to stop them from turning her into the monster she has been so afraid of becoming.This book has so many amazing aspects. First, the . Mafi’s writing style is poetic and beautiful, allowing the reader to have a deeper understanding of Juliette’s thoughts and feelings. I absolutely adored it. However, I do know that this style doesn’t work for everyone, but I honestly feel if you keep with the book, you will grow to love it no matter your first impression.I think that idea is important to another area of this book. The . The development these characters go through is amazing. While at the start they are interesting, they become absolutely fascinating and amazing over the course of this series. Especially Juliette herself. The love story also shares that amazing development. While the is adorable and fun at first, as Juliette develops, so does all of her relationships. In the first book, the characters and the main relationship isn't anything groundbreaking. It's fairly typical and Juliette can be a little too passive at times. But I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to stick with this series until the end. All of the characters are amazing (especially Warner and Kenji, I love them), and they really make this book stand out.The is probably the weakest aspect. While good, it isn't completely original or fascinating type of dystopia. If you have a bit of dystopia-fatigue, I can see why it may be a negative. Later in the series, it becomes less vague and gets more compelling. The entire trilogy was outstanding.From the world development, to the writing style, to the plot, it stood out. Mafi's use of gives the reader a deeper idea of what Juliette is feeling and thinking, and allows us to understand her as a character that much more. It was very poetically written, as well as intriguing and riveting.Overall, the series is a 5/5, the first one is only a 4/5 when compared to it's sequels. Otherwise, it would be a 5/5 as well."

She learns that the monster and the power she used to knowing as her weaknesses are the greatest strengths that free her and help her fight back. to be honest i didn't like her personality and her character. I love her feelings for everything. she sees the world in a way that no one can see or feel. She sees the world so beautiful somehow and somehow so ugly or terrible at the same time. It's like she sees the layer of the world that no one can see. But I still wish she was stronger and acted better than this. I'm looking forward to see her character development. But I hate her behavior with Warner, she even didn't let him explain or talk. She just judged him the way she liked.“𝗜𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗮𝗯𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗼𝗳 𝗵𝘂𝗺𝗮𝗻 𝗿𝗲𝗹𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗵𝗶𝗽𝘀 𝗜 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗺𝗲𝗱 𝗯𝗼𝗻𝗱𝘀 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗽𝗮𝗽𝗲𝗿 𝗰𝗵𝗮𝗿𝗮𝗰𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘀.

To be honest he tried his best to help Juliette. He wanted her to stop denying who she is and what she could do. He knew Juliette better, understood her and her feelings better but Juliette never cared even once. He tried to help her control her feelings. He tried so much to try convince her to love herself and to stop being afraid of her powers and fight back with the world that had done everything to her but she never listened.𝗞𝗲𝗻𝗷𝗶I love kenji so much.

The storyline talks about a destroyed society and the extinction of human beings, that we need to protect nature, and to understand the feeling of life and the beauty of living beings. Because there are many human beings who cause such pain and destroy the world.So we have to try to not destroy ourselves.“𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗼𝗻 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗼𝘆𝗮𝗹 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗻.𝗜𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿 𝗹𝗲𝗮𝘃𝗲𝘀.

53,4,"(Note: Goodreads friends and followers, you know me by now. You know that, even as much as I love a book, my reviews aren't always a resounding, ""Oh my goodness, you need to READ THIS NOW! YOUR LIFE WILL BE SO MUCH FULLER BECAUSE OF IT!"" I'm not that naive or arrogant to think that the books I love will be the books you love. Instead, my reviews are...chronicles of the experiences I had with books, and if that can help you decide whether certain books will be for you or not, then I'll be all the happier. However, sometimes I am a gushing mess with books I love, and I don't note the flaws present. I will try to be mindful of this tendency of mine as I write this review.)Two years ago, I had my first experience with a young adult dystopian novel: Suzanne Collins's . I fell in love with the characters, found myself fascinated yet horrified by the circumstances of the world, and became invested in a wonderful story that still makes me feel a tangle of emotions to this day. In some respects, 's  gave me some of the same emotions I had back then as I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning just to read what happened next to Katniss, Peeta, and everyone else. left me expectant, worried, and intrigued with every page I turned. It was a stressful reading experience, definitely, but all the stress I felt was pent-up through the heroine, Juliette.Juliette, you see, hasn't been touched for 264 days. Inside of her is a gift that brings agony to anyone she touches, and this strange ability has led to her being locked away in an asylum. Isolation takes its toll on Juliette, and her only real solace is writing away in a notebook and spinning phrases in such a way that they seem overwrought and not entirely rational or ""normal."" Then the unthinkable occurs: Juliette is given a cellmate, and everything she thought she knew begins to expand .is a dystopian novel but, unlike others of the genre, the novel is less about external conflict (though there is some of that; it wouldn't be a novel if there weren't) and more about internal conflict. To make my meaning more clear, let me explain with a comparison: one of my friends recently directed me to about a teenage girl bitten by a zombie and her slow change into one of the undead. What do zombies and one girl's transformation into one have to do with this novel? Because that script is about a big idea (zombie infestation worldwide) narrowed down to a character (Maggie) and her experiences. In some ways, , is much like that: it's about a big idea (a dystopian world headed by a secretive totalitarian government), but instead it focuses on one character's role in it (Juliette). Given how so many writers focus on the ""big ideas"" and sacrifice deep characterization because of it, I was very happy with the way this first novel developed, driven by Juliette and her thoughts.Another hurdle of this novel is the prose, something that I feel will probably alienate many readers since...it's not exactly to read novels with lines like or . As for my experience, I was surprised: the prose didn't bother me. It actually reminded me of a verse novel (which, I know, many people don't like...but I find some of them very lovely, albeit a bit thin plot-wise). And it also helped that the prose the character. Juliette is an isolated girl, left alone with nothing but her own thoughts and words. Her thoughts, eccentric and detailed as they are, are coping mechanisms. The words help her to distance herself from her situation, and even after her life begins to brighten she still relies on her old habits of describing things and actions in an unnatural way. What would have bothered me is if Juliette hadn't seemed a bit ""different"" after spending so much time alone. Then I would have thought her a robot, and the story would not have drawn me in nearly as much.The hero, Adam, and the antagonist, Warner, also managed to get my heartstrings all tangled. I couldn't help noting some of the sweetness and tenderness I had seen in Peeta Mellark's character within Adam Kent. In contrast, Warner...is a sadistic bastard of a character, but his obsession with Juliette and her powers is as sorrowful as it is pitiful and disturbing. Though a part of me dreads the love triangle already beginning to form, a greater part of me finds the dynamics fascinating since Adam and Warner are two opposite ends of the spectrum. One is heroic and kind; the other is cruel and nearly mad during certain moments. Even though it's a no-brainer who the ""right"" choice is, one must wonder how this will all play out if Juliette begins to look at herself as a monster again.I'm not going to lie: the direction this novel takes is familiar yet still a bit surprising. When I opened this book, I hadn't known what to expect...but, near the end, I found myself at a complete one-eighty from what I had first expected. That in and of itself is a good thing, so I'm hoping that the rest of the trilogy will continue to bring surprises to the table. With the ending, I actually felt that I had a glimpse of what Tahereh Mafi had been hoping to accomplish with this novel. It's an origins story of transformation and healing amid darkness, despair, and loneliness.The only major thing that irked me a little in this first novel was that the lack of other female characters was...quite noticeable. It gets a tad annoying that all the other characters (who matter) are boys in this first installment. No matter how strong Juliette becomes as a character, somehow it will feel a little lacking if she's the lone girl amid males. I love strong heroines even more when they have a . As much as I really enjoyed this first installment, my reading experiences with the next two novels may be hindered as far as enjoyment goes if Juliette remains the one girl who matters in the story.Mixed though the opinions may be about this novel, really surprised me with its take on the dystopian genre, narrative style, and characterization. I look forward to seeing what will happen as the story progresses throughout the trilogy, so here's hoping the ride will continue to be exhilarating to me as a reader. As for whether should try this one for yourself...I advise making use of preview chapters before committing to read the entire novel. isn't going to be for everyone, but I hope that it will find the readers who will appreciate and savor it for what it is ."
54,2,"Quick thoughts on this for now because at this point I’ve read this book three times, and I only reread it this time because I impulse-bought the WHOLE SERIES so I could finally understand what the EFF people love so much about it:- Juliette and Adam are instalove and that’s the only time I’m going to mention that, it’s done, we’ve acknowledged it, and now we can move on- Warner is a lot more interesting than Adam but i’m not sure I understand what he’s so enchanted with Juliette because she is Very Boring- BUT- the conversations she has with him are way more compelling than her constantly asking Adam if he’s all right and him constantly telling her he would stab nine babies if it would put a smile on her face can I get a *SURPRISINGLY LOUD RETCHING SOUNDS*- this book would make a good play- no it would though- the dystopia stuff and the other characters etc is all just set dressing and the real story is just a three-way emotional boxing match between Juliette Adam and Warner- if you stripped out the dystopia angle and made Warner like some kind of business executive and Adam a private security dude and Juliette could still be Rogue then you could have a really good play- it would work on a black stage- the characters move from scene to scene vaguely interacting with an existential and undefined plot but the actual meat lies between the lines of the dialogue and the weird inexplicable relationship between the three leads making it feel rather...abstract- it’s just 300 pages of dialogue and wandering around and then more dialogue- if actually reminded me of Waiting for Godot- seriously- it’s Waiting for Godot- though that kind of falls apart when we get to the bit with the purple super suit, yes the who and the what now!!!- and the fact that this edition has obviously been edited which was SO DISAPPOINTING- all of my favourite lines have been removed- “my jaw is dangling from my shoelace”- “vanilla regurgitations”- “lackadaisical ennui”- “sewage in your nose”- IT’s ALL GONE WHO DID THIS- why did they remove these lines??? it’s been years and i still remember them that’s how special they were- le sigh- anyway let’s keep going and try to forget that everything is changing and we’re all mortal and steadily marching towards the cold embrace of death- bye- P.S. i’m glad we’ve all decided to collectively ignore that the torture chamber was carpeted. it’s fine we don’t need to ask. let’s just move on"
55,2,"Time for a Reread of Shatter Meaka 300+ pages of Hyperboleaka Juliette Whines for 3 weeks and I Endure Itaka I'm Really Only Here for WarnerThis reread has been very helpful in informing me that yes, I do still hate Juliette with the fiery passion of a hundred nuclear detonations.She speaks in riddles, to the point where any self-respecting reader has to rest their eyes & brain every 3 pages to recover. There's no way to escape this issue because - thrice cursed be whoever came up with fucking first person narration - means that we spend the whole book locked inside Juliette's neurotic mind.So, every other line is some insane hyperbole describing Juliette's heart-wrenching inner turmoil about whatever minor event just occurred.And the metaphors get pretty gross. See for yourself: Ew.EW.She really should get that checked by a doctor.No, seriously, GROSS.All of this because Juliette's been on her own all her life and thus lives inside her head. And I get it, Tahereh Mafi wanted to pull the reader into the unique mind of a girl who is, by all professional opinion, clinically insane. But The author should have reigned it in a little, edited out the superfluous metaphors and left only the really meaningful ones, the ones that help give life to the characters and the world.For example, leave phrases like this:And cut ones like this: That's just distracting.So now we get to the second, and more important, issue with Juliette:There's nothing wrong with creating a heroine who struggles with her self-image; this is a natural thing to add to a book targeted at teens. Writing about a journey towards self-acceptance and -love is always a good bet for YA.Things get problematic when we look at how Juliette gains confidence in herself, namely, through the attention of men. At the beginning of Shatter Me, Juliette hates herself and her abilities fiercely, to the point where she has thoughts like these: Then Adam comes along and solves her inner turmoil - caused by a lifetime of abuse - within a few weeks! By doing nothing more than complimenting and touching her! Nu-uh, Juliette, that's not how it works!!My point is that She should be teaching girls that lasting confidence is something you need to discover for yourself, and not by defining yourself based on the men who claim to love you. The moral of Shatter Me is very far from healthy.The last problem with the book is the world built by the ominous ""Reestablishment"". Who are these people, what are their goals, how and in what world did they manage to rise to power? We get answers to none of these questions, and answers don't seem to be on the horizon for book 2 either. For now, We need more clarification about the world where this story takes place.So all-in-all my only reason for continuing the series iswho really deserves a hug."
56,0,guess who's starting starting starting ???I've seen sm of this series and I've finally gotten the strength to try it out <33. Let's hope I can get through the first 3 😔🤚🏼
57,2,"Shatter Me is a teen soap drama on crack transcribed into book form by author Tahereh Mafi. It's funny, highly entertaining, and interesting, to say the least. I'm not quite sure how I missed out on this 100+ long book series during that dystopian romance phase from my early middle school days (*cough* The Selection, Red Queen, Divergent, The Hunger Games, Matched) but I'm glad that I gave it a try. I mean, it was pretty much the combination of all those books smashed together into one so it was a very nostalgic experience.*If you want to read my actual review, skip to the end :)SPOILERS AHEADShatter Me, a recap, written by meOur story follows this girl named Juliette (like from Romeo and Juliette) who's *not like the other girls* because she has magical powers and is hit on at least once by every man under 40 in this book. Juliette lives in some dystopian society where everyone is starving and things are run by this government called the Reestablishment. The world building is most definitely the worst part about the books and all you need to know right now is that it's just a copycat of every other dystopian government ever written (basically everything looks like the Abnigation section in Divergent).Anyway, Juliette lives in this insane asylum/prison like she has been for the past 300 or so days. She's 17 years old which is mentioned about a gazillion times and people die when they touch her which kind of sucks. It's not really clear how long Juliette has had this magical power, but people have been scared of her for as long as she can remember.One depressing day in prison, this hot guy named Adam (like from the Bible) is thrown into her cell. They live together for a few weeks and somehow never touch and we learn all about Juliette's sad life in a series of metaphors that sound poetic and meaningful but typically make no sense: ""Truth is a jealous, vicious mistress that never sleeps, is what I tell him. I will never be okay."" There are also words crossed out ALL THE TIME. Sweet baby Jesus have mercy on my suffering soul. At one point, we had a whole page that said ""I am not insane"" over and over again in crossed out letters (btw Juliette, you most definitely ARE insane). I got the impression that the writing was supposed to be groundbreaking and unique but it never quite hit the mark for me.One day in prison- I mean asylum- a guy with a gun comes in and things go craaazy. All of the sudden, Adam has a gun too and Juliette wakes up in some wacko government building. Juliette finds out that she's in Sector 42 of the Reestablishment which is run by the son of some important dude named Warner (last name; his first name is actually Aaron, like from the Bible). Warner's also hot but she doesn't have any time for him because she's too busy making out and confessing her love to Adam (35% of the way in) who- surprise!- can touch her for some reason. What isn't a surprise is that Adam is actually Juliette's childhood crush and they haven't stopped thinking about each other since she left when she was 14 or something (apparently they fell in love when she was 7).Turns out, tiktok's sexy golden boy, Aaron Warner, is actually a bit of a prick and does lots of bad things like shoot people which Juliette just despises because she's anti-violence. If I had to describe Aaron Warner, I would say that he looks like Nikolai Lantsov, acts like a less-dazzling version of Jacks on a good day and a less-ruthless version of Kirigan on a bad day, and wears black leather gloves (for the first half) like Kaz Brekker because he can't touch her.Warner's proposition is that Juliette can stay alive (or something) if she tortures people for him, but Juliette doesn't really want to do that. Juliette then spends the next few weeks having meals with our boy Aaron Warner and doing some weird trial stuff.One day, Adam and Juliette are about to have sex when they are interrupted (yet again!) by an alarm that says there has been a breach. Apparently, Juliette and Adam have been preparing for this because Adam knows some guys (*cough* rebels maybe, Juliette?) that could help them escape to their happily ever after. Adam is really buff of course so he punches through the window with the intention of jumping down 15 stories, but *gasp* the door bursts open and guess who's standing there? It's Aaron Warner (*cue sexy music*)!Warner starts yelling at Juliette about how HE could love her and treat her like a queen (I'm down) and that Adam is lying to her and just using her to escape. Obviously, Juliette doesn't care and just holds a gun up to his head because she's savage, and then jumps out the window 15 stories and somehow doesn't die. BUT, not before Warner touches her and also doesn't die. Our story just got a little bit more interesting.Juliette and Adam run to an old nuclear energy plant where Adam has a tank stored and they drive away into the sunset. Well, kind of. They drive home to where Adam's 10 year old brother James (like from the Bible) is living all by himself on a street of orphans. Juliette and Adam have some more interrupted sex and Adam's soldier friend Kenji shows up at the house with bullet wounds.Adam gets mad at Kenji because there's a bunch of drama (obviously) with these tracking device things, so they run away. Kenji is objectively one of the best characters in this book, but he also doesn't know how to take anything seriously which makes this whole running-away thing pretty hard.A bunch of stuff happens and- oh no!- Warner and his mob of soldiers find them! With James and Kenji tucked away in some abandoned building somewhere, Adam and Juliette have an epic battle with Warner and his gang. Well, kind of. This epic battle mostly consisted of Aaron confessing his love (tf was this) to Juliette and then proceeding to make out with her against the wall. Don't worry though, because our non-violent savage queen Juliette grabs his gun and shoots him and then runs away. Juliette finds Adam hooked up to a conveyer belt in a slaughter house and they find Kenji and James and drive away into the sunset.Well, kind of. If you haven't noticed by now, this is a teen dystopian drama so of course there's some resistance movement. Kenji takes everyone to this underground resistance movement called Omega Point which is not, in fact, a nursing home, and they all get patched up. It’s run by a guy named Castle (not a Bible name, unfortunately) and there’s also some unimportant British dude that says blimey. Juliette learns about how the Reestablishment has been lying to everyone (oh my gosh, really?) and they are starving everyone for their own profit (how tf this makes sense, i don't know). Juliette also learns that she is not *not like the other girls* because other people have powers too, not just her.Juliette is is happy to learn that she's not special anymore, and has even more interrupted sex with her almost-dead childhood friend Adam whilst thinking about Aaron Warner. And then, of course, we end with Juliette putting on some sexy-looking superhero suit and JOINING THE REVOLUTION.SPOILERS ENDIf you've made it this far, wow. We both have too much time on our hands, it appears. For the most part, Shatter Me was really just like every other teen dystopian ever written. The writing was really something else (for better or worse, but mostly for worse) and the world-building was a complete disaster that was unoriginal and full of holes (ex. why do people even have magical powers anyways?). Many of the characters were flat with the exception of Juliette and a few others and it was way too tropey for my taste. I still enjoyed it though and thought that it was a very entertaining experience so maybe I'll read the next few books (but only for Aaron Warner's redemption arc and for Adam to have his heart broken). I can definitely see how this is some people’s favorite book, but it just wasn’t really my cup of tea."
58,4,"The writing style intrigued me and although at times I was irritated with Juliette, I couldn't help but enjoy this book! I flew right threw it in two days! Here's my booktalk with all my thoughts and musings: http://youtu.be/Ihe6hYaUTRA =D"

60,4,"“Raindrops are my only reminder that clouds have a heartbeat.That I have one, too.”Story ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Juliette was in a prison cell for nearly one year trying to survive her life in a dark, lonely room. There was no one to talk to, nothing to read, to do.She only had a small notebook where she wrote down her feelings, her thoughts. She poured her heart out into this pages. The guilt, the loneliness of never touching anyone.But then she got a new cell mate. A boy with blue eyes, that she remembered and a name she always liked, Adam.Shortly after she gets a cell mate they’re being brought to a young man - Warner who rules this sector and is making Juliet a great deal.Did you hear that Shatter me will become a series on TV? I’m super excited for that, even though I can’t really understand how they’re gonna put the first book on screen. In the end not much is happening. But we get a lot of Juliette’s thoughts.Throughout this book is mostly character driven in my opinion. But it is still really really addictive. There is some action, that’ll make you gasp out loud and there are scenes with so much passion/love/fear/anger that you’ll love this book even more.Characters ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Even though Juliette isn’t the perfect character, she still has her good parts.Of course she is a little bit weak and cries sometimes, but that’s only because she is afraid. Of the world, her skills and herself.She has such a big, kind and wonderful heart that she doesn’t want anyone get hurt. Especially the ones who are kind to her.Being trapped in a prison cell for nearly a year and never seeing kindness or love in the eyes of others, I’m not surprised that Juliette tries to seek out good and bad people she meets.Oh Adam, you were never my favorite character. You always seemed like a protective, romantic guy, but after reading this whole trilogy a few times I see you clearly.I see that you love the weak side of Juliette. The side that needs protection. You don’t see how strong she can be. That, sometimes, she doesn’t need the saving or protection from others.She needs someone to support her.To show her that she can be more than the weak, locked up girl, that can’t be touched.But then you always protected her when she needed protection.You were kind to her when no one was.You searched for her years of your life, because you wanted to see her, you wanted to know her save.In the end you were always a nice guy with a kind heart.Warner is our “villain” in this story and as I said a lot of times: I love the “villains” of stories. Nearly always.For me they seem to be the most interesting character. And that’s exactly what I love about Warner. He is young and he is ruthless. He is strong, but he is also extremely intelligent. He knows how to hold his power.And even though you could think he is the perfect villain of this story he is also supportive of Juliette. He tries to show her that she is capable of more, that she has so much potential to be great. Even though she doesn’t want to see it sometimes.Oh and of course we have the best and most amazing side-character there could be.Kenji ♥️He’s just so funny and I loved him from the start.World ⭐️⭐️⭐️The world building in this one is really really little. It seemed like a introduction to the whole world.We can be sure that this is a dystopian novel, but we don’t know what happened to the world and why it is the way it is know, but we know that it’s not right. That there is a regime that shouldn’t be ruling and people lose hope for a better world.Relationships ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Even though I wasn’t really fond of our main character and love interest Adam, I can’t say he isn’t madly in love with Juliette.The things he says to her, even though we all know it can’t be this wonderful true love on first sight he says it was, were filled with so much love, romantic and happiness.It was beautiful.If you love unconditional sometimes irrational but beautiful love, then this is the book for you.(But definitely continue the series, there’s something better coming our way)Writing style ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️The first time I read this book, the thing I liked the most about it was the writing. It was so poetic, so full of beautiful descriptions of feelings.The second time I read it, I wasn’t in the mood for this book or his writing. That’s why I felt it was too much.But now I changed my mind, like all human being do sometimes, and now I fell in love with it. Again.If you’re a person who don’t really like unrealistic metaphors, then you probably don’t like this writing.But if you have a huge imagination and love absolutely weird metaphors and description, then this is the book for you.And if you tried it once and you hated it, just wait a little bit maybe in another time with another mood you’ll like it."
61,1,"this is the worst book i've read this yearthe writing was so bad, it didn't even make sense half of the time.He gave me a small smile, the size of Jupiter.what the fuck does this mean, what the fuck does this even mean.the story was so boring, it took me several months to finish. the whole setting wasn't even explained once. so people don't have food? and air? seasons and animals are also gone? but somehow some still have food? how are you all breathing? apparently animals are actually still there but the Reestablishment locked them away? what the fuck is the Reestablishment anyway? how did we even get here? was it global warming? will you ever tell me? do i even care?but the worst part were definitely the characters.juliette is as interesting as a piece of wet moldy bread. she also cries a lot and her thoughts are either a pity party for herself or horny time ™. but it's okay because she's good and pure cause she let her classmate copy her homework that one time many years ago. she is also the love interest for every single male character in this. it's because she's so hot and irresistible, and not because she's literally the only female character.i'm not sure adam has any kind of personality. he's just there and his kisses are apparently so irresistible that you just have to stop and make out with him while you're in the middle of fleeing from your enemies. i mean there's just no other way right? what you gonna do? wait until you're safe? nah, why bother. also why not throw in some dirty talk while one of you is bleeding to death. it's now or never!i gotta admit, warner was kinda hot. for the first ten pages. then he turned into a simp. rip to him. he's not dead but his taste in women is so awful, his death would be a mercy to everyone involved.tldr: i think goodreads should provide the option to give zero star ratings just for this book."
62,1,i re-read this and all i gotta say is that kenji carried this
63,3,"UPDATE: I stand up slowly, suddenly shaking with anger, hoping my legs won't collapse beneath me. ""You think that because I am unwanted - because I am neglected and - and discarded -"" My voice inches higher with every word, the unrestrained emotions suddenly screaming through my lungs. ""You think I don't have a heart? You think I don't feel? You think that because I can inflict pain, that I should? You're just like everyone else. You think I'm a monster just like everyone else. You don't understand me at all -"" ""Juliette-"" ""No."" I don't want this. I don't want this life.Now look at this: From Jane Eyre. (Thanks Lanna)When I first read the quote in the book, I kept thinking I had heard it before. I was so sure about it. Now I realise it's from watching the movie. I kind of ignored the feeling out of guilt, but obviously I was remembering a particular part in the movie. Yeah.. I'm not sure what to think of this. I mean, is it supposed to be a tribute to the book of some kind? Let me know what you think :/My Thoughts - Juliette hasn't touched or talked to a single soul in 263 days. She is now part of a new world. A world where animals are close to extinct, the English language soon lost, books and our history on the verge of being erased and even birds have stopped flying. Being close to starved in a cell and alone for so long has taken it's toll. She is a broken girl who has given up and learned to not fight back in order to survive. But when she finds herself with a new cell-mate: Adam, she's horrified. She recognises him, or so she thinks. But this boy isn't like the others. He looks at her with kind eyes, he's curious. His curiosity could get him killed. He doesn't know what she's capable of. That her touch is lethal.SHATTER ME is very entertaining. Heck, I straight up devoured the book and had a good time doing so. But it doesn't come without its flaws. Let me tell you now. I do analyse a lot. So if you're a reader that just wants something enjoyable and fast paced, then you will find that with this book. If you don't care for the things I'm about to mention, and hey, had they not bothered me, this would have been a high four star to a 5 star read. But unfortunately, there were flaws, and they did bother me.First off, I found Juliette very annoying at times. At first, you think that she's been through hell. She's been bullied for being different and even pushed away by her family - which can be traumatising for any child. But as the story progresses, instead of eventually growing out of her shell and being more stronger as a person, she instead remains pretty much a coward. Cowering behind Adam, or in a corner at the mention of threat. Sure, she likes to give Warner attitude, but only because she knows that he won't hurt her. On another note. She comes across as very innocent, vulnerable and naive, but can't seem to stop thinking about how she'd like to have her way with Adam - all the time if I might add.Also, she seems to react to every guy that pays her attention. I mean, you claim to be in love with a particular guy, then what's with all the lusting for the others. In fact, why is it that every attractive guy that she meets falls for her. I know she's supposed to be really pretty, but really? At this rate, forget a triangle, there might just be a darn square! LOL :PHighlights? The sexytimes :) There were many, and the author wrote them very well. I grinned a little, or maybe a lot. As for Adam? As nice and attractive he may be, it was Warner and Kenji that really caught my eye. These two made the book for me. Kenji, girls, is charming and funny. And he completely won me over. Truthfully, when you have Adam and Juliette being so dramatic all the time and constantly declaring their love for one another (which I still don't buy) it's nice to have someone like Kenji around to lighten the mood. But also, he's just really awesome :) Warner, on the other hand is the bad guy. But there's something about this 'bad guy' that you can't quite bring yourself to hate. He may be on the wrong side, but there are instances that show a side to him that makes you soften up to him. He has a vulnerability about him. Clearly he is sad and lonely. There's definitely more to him than meets the eye and I'm very intrigued. He may have obsessive tendencies but there's something about him that's very appealing. It may be wrong, but I doubt I'm the only one who found herself swooning.The metaphors. Gosh, this book is full of them. You know, one or two once a while may seem nice and pretty, but to have 3/4 on every single page just gets annoying and tiresome.I'll give you a few examples:I may have grown fond of James (Adam' little brother), Kenji and Warner, but I found Juliette and Adam rather bland - which is pretty worrying. I felt like Juliette was just your typical helpless girl and Adam your typical protector. They just seemed to stick in these roles throughout the novel - leaving little for character growth. At least Warner and Kenji are interesting. The actual world building was lacking in my opinion. Maybe they'll explain more in the next novel, but I'm still wondering why there wasn't much of an in depth explanation for why things were the way they were. I felt like the book completely headed into the romance and just ignored the world building - which is so crucial when it comes to this genre.It's towards the last few pages that the book takes the ""X Men"" route. And hey, I'm a fan, a big one actually. So all I could see when I saw Juliette was Rogue, only less badass. But I think things went too far.It's a little painful giving this one 3 stars. It's much better than your average read. It has great potential. And a part of me feels like it deserves more. But personally, there are so many things that weigh this book down that I can't see myself giving it more. Warner and Kenji have kept me loyal, though, so I'll be looking out for the sequel. I'm just hoping that there's an improvement in the world building and character development department, because I do see potential. Oh, and less metaphors please."
64,2,"THIRD ATTEMPT AT READINGI actually got through it. Full review to come.RE-READINGSECOND REVIEWI skimmed read this so bloody hard but here are some notes I took before my brain shit itself and couldn't handle the idiocy. The writing is beautiful, definitely but I hate both the plot and the characters.So, without further ado, here are my notes:-- I hate Adam- I hate Juliette-- Warner is creepy af with that quote- seriously- wtf- how is this guy romantic he seems like a creep- YOU WANT TO TELL ME YOU WOULD TREAT ME LIKE A QUEEN AND I COULD LOVE YOU?- he also wants to use her for his gain???? i'm so confused by this how is this not mildly abusive???- i really hope his character changes because if not no thank you- such a classic Edward Cullen and Jacob Black vibe between Adam and Warner too- Still hate Juliette- ok but why is it that the two love interests have the ability to touch her? TOO CONVINENTI don't know, I just found everyone either creepy or having absolutely no personality. 🤷🏻‍♀️2.75 - SPOILERS.confused me. I've seen heaps of reviews recently, praising this book and it's understandable why - but I was left more confused than not. I'll probably finish this series purely to try and understand the hype. I really wish I'd enjoyed this. I mean, I did in a way but for the most part I was confused. The writing felt jerky, Juliette's inner monologue was strange, the romance came out of nowhere, and the world building took me almost 75% of the book to work out.I think the only character I actually liked was . I felt he was the most realistic for this dystopia like setting. He wanted power and I could understand that. could be used as a weapon and be easily moulded too considering the lack of love and attention she had experienced in her life. She was fragile and naive in so many ways, something that wasn't shown. In my opinion, after the bullying, murder and abandonment that all featured in her life Juliette should have acted differently. However, the author seemed to want to portray her as strong, which isn't what came across to me. Also, of course our special little snowflake Juliette is beautiful - absolutely stunning from the definition provided when she looks at herself for the first time in ages. If I could punch a female character in the face it would be her. was even stranger to me. I just can't even put in words my feelings towards him. He rubbed me the wrong way and every time he came up I cringed. I didn't understand why Juliette and Adam were so infatuated with each other. They'd known each other at 14 and they're now 17. It felt underdeveloped and immature.This quote basically made me sick. I can't stand weak heroines and I can't stand an under developed romance that leaves me wanting to run head first at a brick wall. It's one of my pet peeves in books that drives me absolutely mental.Onto my main problem with the book: . I couldn't handle the constant strikeouts through every other word or wordswordsangerangerwordswordsTrying to look like poetry. It made my brain hurt. Was the book meant to be a representation of Juliette's diary? Was it meant to just be the childishness of her underdeveloped mind? . I also couldn't imagine anything. Too many similes and metaphors that made me feel like I was back in high school and deconstructing the assigned book.There were inconsistencies as well. Juliette states that her parents moved her around lot in shame, because she'd be kicked out of school or because she'd done something weird. However, when Adam and Juliette are taking he refers to several years of schooling which aren't consistent with the statement uttered before. If Juliette was always doing weird things happen how would it be possible for her to stay at a school for several years and only be pulled out once she killed a small child? Also, there was minimal remorse for the death of child that left me speechless. I killed a fish by accident when I was 11, I still think about it to this day which is 8 years later. When I was 9 I had a rabbit and he died within days of getting him, I still wonder what I could have done to save him ten years later. But Juliette only mentions this young boy when suited to her. Maybe she's insane? Maybe isolation in no way helped her? I'm not sure. But I'm quite furious about it.To continue the inconsistencies, if earth is becoming a wasteland why is technology so advanced? Like I don't understand how Warner had a room just out of high tech torture chamber but no one is able to supply food for themselves?There were may too many time lapses as well in which we aren't informed what's happening either. It left me wanting to slam my head against a wall repeatedly. I didn't know what was happening but I was disappointed by this book. Maybe I went in with expectations too high, but overall I'm going to rate this book a 2.75."

MY TOUCH IS POWER. ★'s“Hope is hugging me, holding me in its arms, wiping away my tears and telling me that today and tomorrow and two days from now I will be just fine and I'm so delirious I actually dare to believe it.”“You're my bird.YOU'RE MY BIRD andYou're going toHELP ME FLY AWAY.”Reread <3This is my second time reading ""Shatter Me"" and I must say, I do still love it! It still gripped me from the very first page and kept my attention the whole way through. I love the plot, the characters, and I just love Tahereh Mafi writing-style, strike-outs and all. Even though I will admit it was a bit pretentious at times and repeated the same words over and over again. But I think we needed all that, to help us understand Juliette's unstable mind, after living so many years with no real human interaction and with no one but herself for company. It makes sense she'd be a little insane yeah? Really though this is such a wonderful story, a few minor irritations are easy to overlook. Other than my love for ♥Juliette♥ and most everyone else, there are a couple people who really stick out for me :D Like my man ♥Warner♥. I find Warner to be the most intriguing character. You could say, I kinda have a soft spot for the bad, troubled and misunderstood. They just have so much potential, room for growth and really the most interesting. The other favorite would have to be♥ Kenji♥ ;) I just love his fast-talking, smart ass mouth and damn is he hilarious. That guy has me cracking up constantly. Anyways I have always loved anything involving magical powers, rather it is a book, movie or a t.v. show. There is just something so compelling about it, I can't get enough."

68,1,"Rating: Easily 'one of the worst books I've ever read in my life' 20 negative stars.Important Note: I have it *all* figured out! Shatter Me explained in five steps:(1) Grip Bella Swan from Twilight and put Juliette her into a poorly written dystopian backdrop. Remember to throw a few plot points into the barely-there story.(2) Magnify Bella's stupidity, immaturity, lack of common sense and annoyance by 20 times.(3) Throw in one good boy love interest, and one bad boy love interest for the messy and irritating love triangle.(4) Insert a lot of YA cliches, tons of purple prose and metaphors that either look ridiculous or make absolutely no sense.(5) Add long descriptions of Bella telling us all the details about her love interest's eyes and other gorgeous body parts.Put (1) to (5) together, then eventually...you have !Next, let's do a breakdown.Believe me, honestly can prepare me against this level of shitty shits:The premise:Chapter Two, page 5:Some other reviewers had already pointed out in their reviews thatChapter Two, page 6-7:I admitI admit I don't even understandwhat the three sentences from above are supposed to mean.And there are more....There really are so much more...(Chapter 12, page 74)(Chapter 30, page 208)Good grief! what is this supposed to mean?!If you want more examples, please check outTo make a long story short:Believe me, I am not used to give out criticism to someone else's writing when my own English isn't all that great at the first place, but all these butchery of English within this book are making me feel , it reads like a teenage girl thinks she is writing a fucking sonnet *and* fully expecting readers to give her gold medals for her prose.I'm adding a shelf called especially for this book.And let me tell you one thing:If you think the world building in YA dystopian novels like , , and etc is bad, then wait till you read .To be frank, if we stripped the flowery prose and the false dystopian wrapping away, Then why would I want to re-read Twilight when this time the story is set in a messed up, barely explained dystopian world?First thing: the heroine is one of those YA girls:(Link: )I am supposed to believe even after years of imprisonment, constant starvation, having only one set of clothes to wear and barely allowed to take a shower, Juliette can still manage to look stunning and attractive.Also, I am supposed to believe Juliette is so special, so full of goodness, so pure, so innocent that she continues to care for others and bears no ill-will toward anyone, even when everyone has basically treated her like dirt and locked her up in an asylum for years.To make thing even better, I had to endure Juliette moaning, crying and whining about her bad childhood and how she is a monster *for a whole book*, when people are starving everywhere and the whole world is some shit.Good Boy and Bad Boy! Both of them mouth-wateringly HOT! Argh how possibly can the poor heroine choose between them!? Plus I really hate the Bad Boy love interest Warner, he is an abusive fucker with no redeemable quality.I'd talked enough about how Juliette is an unrealistic character. On the other hand, Adam, the Good Boy love interest, though he seems to be a decent enough human being but I know a lot less about his personality because Juliette, being a lovesick teenager with (a remark by another reviewer), spends a lot more time to be obsessed with Adam's blue eyes and features than taking time to notice his personality, hobbies and interests.As to Warner, I'd already mentioned he is a fucker, and also a molester in the latter part of the book.Plus, there is no other female character aside from Juliette, and whenever girls are mentioned by names, most of them are mean, ungrateful little bitches who eagerly bully our poor heroine .Seriously, Kenji Kishimoto is the only character I can tolerate. He at least can hold his shit together. I hold he will stay this way in the latter books.In the end,How original.Come on, why would anyone think is a good idea?"

70,4,"“I'm oxygen and he's dying to breathe.”I enjoyed this book heartily despite that world-building. Shatter Me gave me much more than an entertaining ride, the book shocked me with its characters. Yes, Juliette is such a doleful character and she isn't the one leading the story into a good way. Not at all ! But Warner and Adam are my reasons for liking this book and going crazy. Adam is just like a good guy trying to impress the girl he likes. But Warner, a handsome and dark guy, took my breath away.- Adam. He is my focos in this bok. His personality will make you swoon relentlessly from the first page. I don't know why I liked him this much. Maybe he's too kind to Juliette and my heart just melted for him, and the romance scenes in this book are super intense and also made my heart wobbly.- The love triangle is hard to decide on whose side you're on. ADAM or WARNER. I couldn't even choose them. When Adam is with Juliette, they're so cute. And when she's with Warner, everything about them is a bit sexual, I could feel it. Trust me, the love triangle is the only thing making this book bearable for me. But if you're NOT a fan of it, I think this book might not work for you and you'll get annoyed easily.- Warner will shake your heart and rock your world. He's a veryyyy bad guy and will stop at nothing to own Juliette. You can't resist him no matter what you do and you'll be torn between him and Adam at the end. Of course, I've said this twice already.- The story is enjoyable and I didn't get bored by it. The narration is not complicated at all and the setting is very easy to understand. Instead of not liking it as other people, I found the writing style awesome and hard to forget. It's unique but it does something good for the book, though.- The worldbuilding is NOT good. She created the world where mutants are confined and banished, which is alike what happens in X-MEN. The heroine, Juliette, runs away from her miserable life at the beginning, nothing new to intrigue me. And she also tells nothing about the origin and development of the power.- Juliette was annoying sometimes. She's insipid at first but around the middle she does get better. But even now, I don't really understand why she's the center of Adam and Warner's attentions. Aside from her power, she doesn't have something good at all."
71,3,"❥ 3.5 / 5 starsI’ve seen a lot of negative and positive reviews about Shatter Me series and they made me uncertain whether I should read this series or not because many books have let me down recently and I’m not in a mood to feel that way again. But to be honest, I don’t regret deciding to pick it up at all. After finishing the first book, I think it was not that bad as I’ve seen some reviews say. Although I felt like it was a romance novel more than dystopia or fantasy novel (cuz I didn’t expect to experience so much romance like this.😂) and there was something in the story that did not make sense, I still enjoyed reading it and it was definitely a page-turner for me.I won’t say that I love this series since I’m not sure myself yet. But I’m gonna give other books in the series a try. I hope the next one will get better than this, then I’ll decide again. :)"

73,3,"3 Stars!Spoiler Free ReviewSo… I’ve finally read Shatter Me after I’ve been asked for however long! was it great? It wasn’t what I expected, I had my ups and downs with the book, but I’m too far gone, and far too intrigued not to read Unravel Me. In particular the last few chapters were just so interesting and it had me questioning so many things, like I want to know what’s going to happen next, I can’t deny that! The reason why it only got a 3.5 stars is simply for the fact it felt like a “starter” book, it seemed like an introduction to the characters for the next two books. The reason I say this, is because I don’t think a lot particularly happened, and I got NO ANSWERS! I need these answers or I will actually combust!this is going to be so vague, I have no idea what to think about her, I really don’t… and that goes for a lot of the characters. I think because so much is un-answered I don’t really know where to begin with anyone...Firstly we have , when we first meet her she is trapped in a cell, her thoughts are very all over the place, we see her not trust herself and her actions, but we don’t really find out until further on in the story. I’m looking forward to see how she develops and what she’s going to do with her power.I have no idea what to think about , I really don’t. I can’t put my finger on it but he’s a bit meh for me. His back story was good, but I want to know more. Like I said this would be vague, because I have literally no idea what to think of him.Probably an unpopular opinion here… BUT I really really cannot stand , he’s such an arse, he’s so controlling and forces Juliette to do things she clearly doesn’t want to do. For me, it seemed like he thought he was entitled to have Juliette as his property, and I’m not on board for that I’m afraid. So for this book, Warner is a big nope from me.Finally my saving grace is 10000000% he was in it for the second half of the book, and I him! He was so funny, he liked to wind people up, and had lots of secrets for himself! He needed to be serous when the time came to it, his endless flirting with Juliette was so funny! There was a difference between how he treated her compared to Adam and Warner, he did it in a friendly way, and I’m hoping him and Juliette become good friends out of this!What I- The writing was so easy to follow, it was really fast paced and I loved that it was kind of static, for example when Juliette was thinking something and then it would be crossed out, I thought it was really clever how they’d done that.- We got a few back stories- Those last few chapters were so good!- I have so many questions about what’s going to happen AND I’m very very intrigued!What I- The story didn’t seem to take off until the second half of the book, and like I mentioned previously it seems like a starter book.- Warner really really pissed me off, I don’t have time for controlling characters (however I do want to know his back story)- I found it really difficult to actually like characters and be invested in them, until Kenji came along I honestly could’ give a shit about any of them and that’s putting it nicely…- Where was the world building?!Overall, it was okay, it’s setting up the next book perfectly and I can’t wait to find out what happens! I just hope that it has more of a story to it, because how it ended I NEED MORE!Shatter Me - 3 Stars- 4 Stars- 4.5 Stars- 4 Stars"
74,4,"I read this in 2 days. 2 DAYS!!Not bragging or anything, but for a slow sloth like me, that's a pretty good accomplishment, don't ya think??This story didn't have a lot of pages, but for some reason, you're just compelled to finish it. Is this a magical spell? No, it's because this book was BRILLIANT. Mafi creates an entire world with action, suspense, crazy hot boys and all that shit.Now, a lot of people said that they liked Warner, but for me, my childish brain fell in love with the first boy my eyes set on.Yup, it was Adam.For some reason, this dude happened to capture my attention and made me absolutely despise Warner. I HATED Warner. I thought he was a pervert, honestly. XDAnd with this hatred, I absolutely LOVED it when Juliette escaped with Adam to a sort-of happily ever after. Now you see why I finished this in two days??And not only that, the action and just plain awesomeness of this book made it a terrific read. You'll love it. :)"
75,1,"I’m too old for this shit.This book has barely enough plot to be able to . I’ve read erotica with more plot and character development than this so called dystopian. It was so bad it started to be funny and ended up being a torture.An accurate summary of this book could be ""1 girl + 2 boys = all horny af and cock-blocked by the apocalypse.""We got Juliette, the ONLY female character in the whole story. It’s just her and a bunch of guys, all horny for her. She’s constantly being called beautiful and sexy. Men go crazy whenever she takes a shower because she is so clean, I mean sexy.At some point the whole military base is leering at her in a not so subtly rapey threat but it's okay, y'all. She's just really hot.Things we know about Juliette: She is sexy af. She’s beautiful. Every man who meets her falls in love with her. She’s supposed to have these superpowers where her touch can kill you, and she’s also hella strong. Does she ever use these powers for shit? Nope, she does not.She’s gotten the most tragic backstory, tho. Prepare the tissues. Her parents stopped touching her the moment she started crawling (literally). She’s never known love or affection from them. At school, kids would bully her. Beat her, insult her… And yet, she was always a saint to all of them. Because she’s .No book is completed without a good ol’ love triangle, and here is where the main two guys show up.We got NiceBoi, aka FuckBoi in disguise, Adam.Adam is hot, the most important attribute any of these characters has. He’s tall, strong and has blue eyes the author spends 20% of the book describing in ridiculous metaphors. He’s also gotten tattoos… I’m going to give you a moment to recover from that incredibly hot fact. . Swoon.He’s also a creep and a stalker, who spent their childhood observing her from afar without talking to her or defending her from her bullies. He’s also hella horny. The moment he realized he can touch her without dying, that’s all they do. They make out at any given chance. Even when running for their lives, they stop for some heavy petting. It’s funny how their relationship is based on them wanting to fuck and being constantly cock-blocked. But it’s okay, guys. Because they are !Then we got BadBoi Warner.Oh god, he is so… /bad/. So… /hot/. So… /tragic/.Warner is, surprise, very hot. He carries guns and shoots people, too. Hot, I know. And another 20% of the book is dedicated to metaphors of his green eyes. He’s completely psychotic, obsessive and has mommy issues (super hot). He wants Juliette to choose him, so he keeps forcing her to do so . What a catch, y’all. He spent years searching for her, keeping her medical records, spying on her… but don’t worry because it’s all supposed to be very romantic! He can also touch her without dying. Which… *sigh* I’m getting a headache at this point.Both super hot men spend the book pressing her against walls and her while she stays there, unmoving, feeling all the feels and creating a million metaphors in her head. It’s all so .How is a girl supposed to pick between these two amazing catches?As for the lack of writing skills and the over the top metaphors, all I have to do is show you some of them:I know, right?P.S.: Juliette should see a doctor, those sound like symptoms of something serious."
76,5,"5 — I love Aaron — STARSI'm a little late in expressing my love for this absolutely amazing book, but here I am! 😗— I am completely, deeply, madly, passionately, obsessively, fucked up-ly in love with Aaron Warner! I would do anything for him! 😭💕— You try to justify their actions, knowing how wrong they were! That's exactly what I did in this book!— I already knew that Juliette chose and not . Good choice, Juliette! 💯 So, I was already Team Warner before starting this book!— This book was an incredible rollercoaster of emotions! I finished the whole thing in just three hours, I swear! It was so captivating that I couldn't even put it down for a moment! I finished two books in one night! I wish I could read it again right now. 🥲 (I'll definitely be rereading this series soon!) 😮‍💨— They were truly heart-wrenching! She is such a pure soul, and what she went through was terrible! 💔— I don't hate Adam! I never did (ok sometimes 💀 but it's more like i disliked him), not even after what he did in Imagine Me or the things he said. (I'm a kind soul. 😂) But there were times when I really, really loathed him! However, he did help Juliette a lot in this book, even though he treated her as fragile or a charity case. 🥱— He always encouraged her and made her believe in her own strength!To be honest, Aaron is exactly what I need in books! He's a true psychopath, yet he's so self-aware, and his POV is unbelievably logical and profound! And the best part is,— Aaron's clothing, his way of talking, his dialogues, his actions.... everything he has ever done has me on my knees, melted into a puddle! 🥵"
77,4,"This book reaaally surprised me.it was melodramatic, well our MC was anyway. the strikeout texts were grating. the beginning was slow and we still didn't know much about this world.But this book in one aspect.Tension, chemistry, blushingly sexy, it was incredibly intense between Juliette and Adam. I love them as couple so much in this book!And then we have. . . . . . . . . . . . Umm.............Ok what was I talking about??Sorry suddenly lost my train of thought after that name was mentioned...As for the other aspects -My gosh I can't tell you just how much, how much I can relate to Juliette.. Doesn't it sound weird? I mean I can't kill people with my touch, I'm not locked up either BUT I felt so acutely, at times it actually hurt.Someone (I think Weston) called her condition and I think it was appropriate and made my sympathy for her ran even deeper. She was, in a way, dealing with her own special kind of illness.. And Christ, don't I know how hard that is! I can almost feel her pain!====right after finishing====Reading the first chapter, seeing the writing style, I didn't realize I would be enjoying it as much as I did! I'm shocked!"
78,5,"English - EspañolNo one knows why Juliette's touch is fatal, but The Reestablishment has plans for her. Plans to use her as a weapon. But she has her own plans.These series is among the best I read in 2016 and still love it in 2017. I like the main characters, especially Warner. I do not think he is as bad as he seems and that Juliette cares more than he seems. Just as I think Adam is not so good and he has another interest in her besides love.I think that Sarah J. Maas used this series as inspiration for her acotar series.✨✨✨Nadie sabe porque el toque de Juliette es fatal, pero El Reestablecimiento tiene planes para ella. Planes para usarla como un arma. Pero ella tiene sus propios planes.Esta serie estuvo dentro de mis mejores lecturas del 2016 y aún la adoro en 2017. Me gustan los personajes principales, especialmente Warner. No creo que el sea tan malo como parece y que le importa Juliette mas de lo que aparenta. Así como creo que Adam no sea tan bueno y que tiene otro interés en ella además de amor.Sigo pensando que Sarah J. Maas usó esta serie de inspiración para su serie acotar."
79,4,did i see one singular quote from this series that was the sole reason i bought this book? no yes.so ready to devour the rest of this!
80,4,"Strolls into yet another series six years later and mentally beats herself up for waiting so long = MY LIFE IN A NUTSHELL.It’s safe to say I miss dystopian books. I haven’t read a book like this in SO LONG. Seriously, it’s been years.My thoughts on this so far:-Warner is probably bae even though he’s psychotic-Kenji needs to be protected at all costs-Adam is shady AF, even though he’s literally done nothing to prove that I just don’t trust him-I’m stoked to find out other people’s gifts-Need to understand why certain people can touch Juliette-Juliette thinking about Warner warms my insides-HOW SOON CAN I START THE NEXT BOOK?!?!See y’all later, I’m about to go marathon this series in time for book 4 to come out."
81,2,"More like 2.5 starsI have to say I was expecting more from this book, especially because of all the hype surrounding the series.......hopefully the next two will win me over."
82,3,"So like many of you, I read this because of the internet's obsession with Aaron Warner. I can confirm he is worth the obsession, even just from this book alone. That being said, I quickly discovered that the only times I actually enjoyed reading this were whenever Warner happened to be front and center. As an aside, I know that this is the textbook definition of a YA dystopian novel with romance. And that's fine. But this is basically the x-men...a group of teenagers with superpowers saving the world under the direction of one very wise and fatherly man who has telekinesis. Now enter the handsome Aaron Warner, who is essentially the villain but more importantly also happens to be the most interesting aspect of this book. I probably would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd read it in junior high or even high school. BUT that being said, because of, and I cannot emphasize this enough, BECAUSE of Aaron Warner I will continue onto the next book. If he were not a part of this, I would stop with book one. If I didn't know, thanks to booktok, that Juliette ends up with Warner (I don't think this is a spoiler since everyone knows), I would stop with book one (Adam is just not it). So yes. Read it for Aaron Warner. Stay (with the series?) for Aaron Warner?Redeeming qualities: easy and fast read. Aaron Warner. Unique (and really good) writing style. Aaron Warner. Chemistry between Juliette and Warner. Aaron Warner."
83,5,"Releer Shatter Me es una de las mejores decisiones que he tomado en los pocos días que van del año. Este es uno de esos libros que destaca por su estilo único, pues Tahereh Mafi hace maravillas con las palabras, con la puntuación y, en general, con la construcción de un hilo de historia que va avanzando de la mano con el estado mental de Juliette, la protagonista.Juliette ha estado encerrada en un sanatorio, aislada de cualquier tipo de contacto humano, durante casi un año. Entre paredes oscuras, frío punzante y humedad, se ve obligada a revivir en su cabeza lo que la envió a este lugar: su toque es letal. El simple roce de su piel con el de otra persona significa dolor, tortura, muerte. Encerrada en su mente, Juliette se cree un monstruo y se convence de que merece ser olvidada, maltratada y dejada de lado de una sociedad que, a fin de cuentas, está desmoronándose poco a poco. El clima ha cambiado, los animales han muerto y El Restablecimiento manda. Sin embargo, un día algo cambia: llega otro prisionero a su celda... Adam. A partir de ese momento, Juliette empieza a pensar que todo es una trampa, un juego cruel que va a terminar con su ejecución, un experimento. Y es que, en medio de circunstancias inesperadas, romances nuevos, recuerdos del pasado y una guerra por pelear, Juliette se da cuenta de que Warner, uno de los grandes comandantes del Restablecimiento, quiere su poder, quiere usarla como un arma de tortura... y la quiere a ella.¡No puedo decirles lo bueno que es este libro! Lo tiene todo, de verdad. Si bien es el primer libro de la trilogía, nos da un muy bien primer vistazo a este mundo post apocalíptico en el que se desarrolla. Empezamos a entender cómo funcionan los engranajes de un sector del Restablecimiento y, más adelante, cómo funcionan otros sectores de la sociedad un poco más . Con conocemos a una protagonista absolutamente quebrada al principio, una chica a la que le han enseñado que es un monstruo y que no merece nada más que desprecio. Conocemos la historia de cómo llega a estar encerrada en un sanatorio siendo objeto de experimentos y vejámenes. Pero también vemos cómo su historia empieza a abrirse y desarrollarse cuando Adam entra en su vida, cuando sale de la celda por primera vez en casi un año y cuando se encuentra de frente con personas que sí merecen el título de monstruos.Quizá una de las mejores cosas de (y probablemente no habría dicho esto la primera vez que lo leí, pero ahora sí porque he leído la trilogía completa) es Warner. Este hombre encarna todo lo que un personaje fascinante debe ser. En este primer libro nos lo presentan como alguien malo hasta la médula, alguien que no dudaría en matar otra persona con el fin de conseguir sus objetivos, un hombre calculador, frío, cruel... y extrañamente atractivo. Warner es de esos personajes que tienen cierto aire de poder, de locura y de inteligencia que te termina atrayendo por las razones incorrectas. En es un personaje que no terminamos de conocer del todo, pero que promete (y cumple) grandes papeles en los siguientes libros.Adam, por otra parte, es el personaje Príncipe Encantador. Con un pasado supremamente oscuro y motivaciones clarísimas, Adam es el chico que sacrifica su vida por salvar a los que le importan. Es la persona que se une al ejército para alimentar a su familia. Es aquel que no miraba raro a la niña que todos decían que era un monstruo, es quien ve la humanidad en Juliette. En este primer libro, Adam y Juliette son una fuerza de la naturaleza, son terremotos, son tsunamis, son sentimientos, son pasiones, son dos bombas que pueden destrozarlo todo. Y, créanme cuando les digo que Tahereh Mafi logra transmitir la fuerza de los sentimientos de estos dos en el papel. Las palabras te acarician.Más allá de tener una gran historia de amor, es una distopía como pocas. Y, si bien este primer libro es un abrebocas, nos cuenta lo suficiente como para que deseemos conocer más del Restablecimiento, los Regimientos, Warner, las mentiras, Omega Point, Juliette, Adam, James, Kenji y todos los demás personajes que aparecen en estas páginas. Nada, absolutamente nada, está como decoración en . Cada palabra, cada tachón, cada coma invisible, cada espacio tiene su intención.

84,5,"Goodbye my delusioned innocent love for this book, I'm not 16 years old anymore. My innocence has been shatterd. Did you see what I just did there?Well, to be honest I realised I wasn't that innocent at 16, with the amount of kissing and tasting Adam and Juliette are doing in this book.Warning: My love for a certain character in this book may spoil you on the relationship aspect of the story.that my eyes aren't permenantly stuck on the back of my head from all the eye rolling I did because of our I-don't-know-the color-of-my-eyes heroine: JULIETTE.Just calm down.And don't even get me started on how she didn't eat the food Warner gave her. I was shaking my head the whole time WHILE rolling my eyes.Am I the only one who thinks that Juliette and Adam are the horniest teenagers on earth? I mean what's with all the TASTING. if you're hungry just go and eat something!I get it: Juliette hasn't touched anyone in 386546567 days or whatever. But kissing while running for your lives is just STUPID.The first time I read this book, I swooned a little while reading about his tattoos, blue eyes and tall lean body. Now, I just wanted to BARF everytime he was in the book. He's a good guy. Kind of swoon-worthy, I mean tattoos But knowing what I know. I just couldn't like him anymore.He may be a psychotic obssesive muderer in this book. And I LOVED HIM! I seriously started questioning my sanity because of my love for him.Warner:me: okay, whatever you say you green-eyed lovely kitten.Warner:me: Yes please! Can I hug you... forever?Warner:me: I love you... you cute muffin that I want to eat.The way everyone treated him in this book made my blood boil.I can't. I just can't with these two horney teenagers. And the kind of insta-Love that they have going on. Can't you keep your hands to yourselves for a whole minute. CAN YOU?Don't get me wrong I still really like the book. But Adam and Juliette got on my nerves too much."
85,5,"Review: (EDITED)Im sorry I can't hear y'all over the sound OF ME FK SCREAMINGWHATTHE ACTUELFLYING FUCKWAS THAT.Everytime i see , it's like when the feels hit you and you're left writhing on the floor clutching your heart because you can't handle the intensity and It's just a feels overload likeyas im totally losing my shit.i fk swoon when confessed his love to , holy hell the ship is fk real and it's cracking me up.and pls who cares if the writing was shitty? or how fk cringy and unbearable was?WHEN U HAVE IN UR LIFE.Gonna take this chance and clear some things about the book. (by the way thank you for sharing your opinion on the matter, I will try to answer you in the following edit. ), I want to put in mind that I already read the Shatter me series and even reread & a couple of times now.And honestly I was always hesitating on picking this one for reasons such as: The writing, whinings 24/7 and of course last but not least, the fk butthurt.fortunately I got over it ages ago, so you see I wanted to reread for a whole purpose and that to dig into it more.Even if i had to torture my soul with the ugly ass kent.well, let's forget about that shall we :))✖ behaviors, towards herself and .✖ And how was treating her then.If you read the whole series (Im sure you all did) you'll notice how much personality changed during the story, and being more and more herself and eventually realised that her love for was only out of desperation, no more then that.and looking at her past, as said before, solitude for a long period can drive people crazy, as well as the gravity of realising that you will be confined between 4 walls, with no one except yourself until you die, and what happened with her family did nothing but worsen her case, so she gave up on being herself.And then came basically from fk nowhere, wanting to protect her and the ""only person"" who can touch her, can you blame her for falling for him?He fk treated her like a disney princess, AND EVEN LOVED HER god i can't I SWEAR TO GAWD UR LUCKY U ENDED UP WITH HIM OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE STABBED UR EYES FOR BEING FK BLIND.All his actions was indeed for her own good, well shit too bad that she realised that after fk 999999 years.i don't know how i survived after reading it.or why the rated it 5 stars..but i know im gonna regret this."
86,1,I bought four of the six books and it's obvious I need my head examined because what in the Tik-Tok fucking mess is this?
87,0,bro who the fuck is ella i thought this was about juliette and aaron???also sidenote: i bought a kindle package of the first 3 books and corresponding two novellas and it’s all grouped together into one book with 1225 pages. that’s really funny to me. don’t ask me why though.
88,4,"~Spoiler-free~SHATTER ME by Tahereh Mafi is the story of Juliette, a seventeen year old girl who has been imprisoned for a dangerous and powerful ability she cannot control. She’s neither seen nor spoken—nor touched—another human being in 264 days; the only indications that she is not absolutely alone are the soldiers marching outside her tiny window and the screams the rend the night through thick concrete walls… neither of which are comforting. Her only outlets are the ragged notebook she keeps balled beneath her mattress and the hope she holds with white knuckles—her only tether to sanity, it seems.Before her existence distilled to four gray walls and one square window, she’d witnessed the degradation of the world—the food shortages, the environmental problems, the panic. She’d watch the Reestablishment step in, heard their promises of solution. She doesn’t know the state of the world now, but she can see the sky is the wrong color and weather follows no discernable pattern—other than holding a beauty she longs to touch.She is utterly alone, cut off from the world and volleying between despair and hope—until she is given a cellmate. Adam’s arrival sets in motion a sequence of events that leads her to the very heart of the Reestablishment regime. She must make a choice: is her freedom worth more than the lives of others—than the lives of those who have taken freedom from her? Is she willing to fight—not only for what is right, but for herself?I loved Juliette. I feel like in a lot of dystopian stories, the author has to choose between making their main character strong, or making them likable—like their strength has to supersede their heart, otherwise they will be considered weak-willed females, improbable in a leadership role. This is not the case with Juliette. Her greatest strength is her heart, beyond even that of her physical power.Which is saying a lot, because her powers? Yeah, they’re super badass, despite being utterly inconvenient and dangerous. I have a feeling we don’t even really know what she’s capable of yet. But I know it will be awesome.The story itself is complex—well-crafted and well-paced with three dimensional characters right on down the line. The antagonist is not a mustache twirling caricature, there were times I felt a pang of almost sympathy for him; I think there are greater depths to his character that have not yet been uncovered. Even the secondary characters are fully fleshed out—I’m halfway in love with Kenji, who provided some much needed levity, and would like to request some serious snuggle time with James.And then there’s Adam. Guys. GUYS. I can’t with Adam. I just… I cannot. That’s all I’m going to say. (Except maybe ohmysweetsparklingjesushe’ssoflippinghotandexactlyzeropercentofmecanhandleit.)There is a twist at the end that I think readers will either love or hate. I am in the love camp. I think it's an exciting idea which, if executed correctly, could bring a unique storyline to the YA world. But it will depend on the execution, as there's a fine line between an exciting and unique spin, and the bastardization of a much loved comic series. However, I have complete faith that Mafi can pull it off.One of the things that really cemented SHATTER ME as a winner for me, was the fact that IT’S A COMPLETE STORY. It has a beginning, a middle and an end that could stand on its own even if there weren’t two more books in the series. I almost wept for the joy of this miracle.The only complaint I have is this: Mafi’s prose is GORGEOUS. From an aesthetic standpoint I was absolutely in love with her writing style—so unique and lovely. As a reader you are completely in Juliette’s head; the narration reads the way a broken seventeen year old’s thought process should. However, I found myself distracted at times, pulled out of the action because I was focusing on actual writing itself. Thinking, “oh, I love the way she put these words together” instead of being totally immersed in what was going on. That is really my only complaint with the story. It's a minor complaint in SHATTER ME, but could prove to be a bigger detraction in the subsequent books, when I assume the action will ramp up and Juliette will be less introspective.In short: this was awesome. You need to read it when it’s released in November."
89,5,"OH MY ACTUAL GOD“All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”I LOVE that this is like 90% romance and 10% dystopian🤪. I am a big fan of the unique writing style, it really added to the emotions for me. Such an immersive read. I wish I had the rest of the books on hand rn like AHHH *crying*!! I know this is only the first book in the series but I’m already tempted to say… GOD TIER🛐?“I spent my life folded between the pages of books. In the absence of human relationships, I formed bonds with paper characters.”Anyways, now on to the important part of this review. WHY DO I BARELY SEE ANY ADAM APPRECIATION?! Like are y’all ok? Am I ok? I know everyone and their grandmother loves Warner🤠. If you like the idea of the sweet, caring, protective, basically perfect guy (I have a fatty crush on Adam’s kind heart😩) vs the obsessed, power freak, maybe intriguing? but psychotic and highkey creepo bad boy... I just found your next read😍. And I mean no hate to Warner (ok maybe minimal hate, I don't exactly like him yet and I can't picture his redemption arc after all that damage🙃). I hope I’ll understand him more in the next book. I have an open mind and high HIGH hopes (I know you've seen those quotes and insta edits🙈😒). Based on just this book though, he has a lot of work to do in our own hate-to-love relationship. I'm not going to let the hype sway my opinions. I was actually very concerned with his behavior💀 especially when you look at everything Adam has done for Juliette🥹. It's a no-brainer, this was clearly Adam's book pour moi >>>. HE'S SO IN LOVE (just like me fr) and since CHILDHOOD😭🫶!!!“It's been me and you against the world forever,"" ""It's always been that way.”Oh and I’m also excited to see Juliette’s continual character transformation!! Let's gooo depressed queen🥳. And girl, I don’t even blame you for rambling about them blue eyes like it was your job because same🥰✌️💘5 FUDGING STARS⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️!!!!!"
90,4,"I thought i was going to hate this series, but surprisingly i like it. It's not the best thing I've ever read, but it's entertaining.Something that i didn't really connected with this book was the writing. it was not for me, and i felt like the plot was... I don't know but it didn't convince me. if there is only one thing that kept me reading this series was the characters. if it wasn't for the characters I'd DNF the whole series, because i didn't care bout the plot or what was going to happen.I liked Juliette in this book, and no, i don't find her boring. and she is not a crybaby, she was literally locked for a long time and her thoughts made me want to cry. i love her. her obsession with numbers made her character more realistic somehow.Adam, on the other hand... he was okay. nothing special, i obviously wanted to know why he was the only one that could touch her. i didn't love him but i didn't hate him.Aaron. he was definitely everything interesting in the book. like i didn't quit reading because of him. i loved him in this book, even tho he was more like a side character in the first book.Kenji, Ohhh my god how i love this guy, in my opinion the best shatter me character is Kenji. he is the cutest, and i loved him and Adams little brother.( please ignore if there are some grammar mistakes. English is not my native language so I'm pretty sure there are lots of mistakes)"
91,1,"changing my rating to 1 star, because this is legit one of the worst book i've ever read. how anyone can think this series book is good literature let alone peak literature is beyond my comprehension. 🧍‍♀️"
92,3,"*3.5*THIS WASN'T AMAZING, BUT IT WASN'T BAD EITHER***Contains Spoilers***The reason why I started Shatter Me was because of this mysterious Warner guy I kept hearing about. A lot of you guys have recommended this to me because you know I have a huge thing for antihero/villain love interests, and in this case, Warner is (I'll get to him soon).Thank you to my Goodreads friends who recommended this to me, because even though I gave this 3.5 stars, I still really enjoyed it and look forward to starting Unravel Me.Once I started reading this book, I could not stop. I absolutely loved the fact that Juliette could kill with just a single touch and how she's been locked up in this prison type thing for a long time. Like, she didn't speak a word in 264 days! If I were her, I would probably go insane and start yelling to myself to make time go by.Anyways, so Adam comes in and stays with her for a couple weeks until they arrive at the Reestablishment. Adam, Adam, Adam, where do I start? I liked him towards the beginning when he was being cocky, but later on, He just became so bland and a Mal-type-character (I always use Mal as an example for these types of guy characters). And he fell too hard and too fast for Juliette. Before I get into her, I'm going to talk about a little thing called insta-love so all y'all can listen up.Insta-love can just insta-die. Now, I understaaaand that Juliette and Adam went to school together and that Adam has had a crush on her for like ever, they haven't communicated in all that time until he was in her cell. And all of a sudden...BAM they're totally head over heals with each other. Their relationship wasn't that developed and it was...well...boring. Like Adam....and Juliette.Alrighty, Juliette. Gurl ,you need a personality makeover or somethin. For a girl who can kill anyone with just a touch of her hand, you're not that intimidating. She felt more like a side character to me because she didn't do all that much or say all that much. Adam was the one constantly taking care of her and I felt like she needed to take charge for once. I hope she will go through some hard core character development in the second book, because guuuurl, you are as bland as waffles...without the syrup. And she needs to work on that blushing problem of hers, she only does it like every other page. Okay, okay, she's really not that bad, she just needs to find her strengths, that's all.Warner is the best character in this book. He is sorta psychotic, a stalker, and a murderer, but hot, so it's okay guys. I don't want to admit it, but he did have the insta-love thing for Juliette, but I ship it still. I shouldn't be shipping things like this, it's so wrong............. And they totally made out, even though Juliette was only doing so to get his gun from his jacket to kill him.Alright, so world building. Didn't like it because there really was no world to build. We hardly got any detail about this polluted dystopian world and I want some! I hope we get more of this needed detail in Unravel Me.And I loved Kenji, he was so fun and his lines cracked me up. Apparently, he can turn invisible now.Lol what.I guess Adam and Warner are the only ones who are able to touch Juliette without dying and I WANT TO KNOW WHY. I DID NOT GET AN ANSWER. I NEED TO KNOW WHY WARNER IS ABLE TO TOUCH JULIETTE.So I guess Juliette's part of the X-Men now. They're like 56 other people with abilities and they are going to try and defeat the Reestablishment who trying to make this perfect society. They hooked up Juliette with this purple onesie and now I guess she's ready to use her powers to defeat evil or some shit.You know what else she could do with that onesie?Okaaaaaay....so again, I did really enjoy this book even though I did have a lot of complaints, but Warner makes up for all of it. I am excited for what the second book will bring and I hope that there will be some character development going on!"
93,1,"After gorgeous gems with effective flamboyantly descriptive writing such as The Final Empire, Fates and Furies and Unteachable, this book was the biggest let down. The prose made sense in those books. The objects and situations being compared in the metaphors made sense. They had unlikeable, morally grey characters (which I have absolutely no problem with and enjoy 99% of the time). BUT WHAT FRESH HELL IS THIS.It was a laughably half-hearted attempt at creating a dystopian setting, with above-the-waist and mild thigh touching abundant, topped off with an incessantly whiny narrator. The only things dystopian about this world were, in Juliette's words, I mean, nothing's really imminently dangerous if you're hanging out outside your house in a frickin' tank sucking face, right? This read like my fifth grade diary. Case in point:Oh, .Juliette as a narrator was wishy-washy and all kinds of inconsistent, almost like it was Nanowrimo and some parts of the character development weren't quite flushed out. She complained about being weak and insufficient but then refused to eat. She flip-flopped between not wanting to kill anyone but then wanting to kill all the people. The storyline concerning her parents was halfheartedly interjected only to be dominated and spoken over by Juliette mooning over Adam's blue eyes.I will say that Juliette is a traumatized person. She cannot form relationships with people because they are terrified of her ability to kill someone with her bare hands, quite literally. She has been kept in a cell for 264 days, and has not spoken to a single soul. So it only makes sense that her language would be a little... Even the insta-love didn't bother me, because after 17 years of killing people when you touch them, I'd be probably pretty attracted to the first person who didn't think I was a monster and I was able to grope in a seventh-grade dance kinda way.First of all, Adam's eyes are blue. They're blue. Don't believe me? Well, Juliette will enlighten you:""His eyes are two buckets of rainwater: deep, fresh, clear.""""His gaze is fixed on me: calm, unflappable; 2 buckets of river water at midnight.""""His eyes are the perfect shade of cobalt, blue like a blossoming bruise, clear and deep and decided.""""His eyes are two pools of perfection, open, honest, humble.""Then there were these gems:""My lungs are burning with the effort to inhale oxygen, wheezing with the effort to exhale carbon dioxide."" We KNOW you inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. THIS IS NOT FOURTH GRADE SCIENCE. WE GET IT.""James and Adam glance back at me and I melt into pink Play-Doh."" PLEASE. JUST MAKE IT STOP.""There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe."" I'm pretty sure there aren't. This sentence is one of many that reminded me of this:""He says it with a small smile the size of Jupiter."" I SEE RIGHT THROUGH YOUR INEFFECTIVE OXYMORONS, JULIETTE.""My stomach is a flimsy crepe."" Like you can't hold the Nutella you're filled with? Can't contain all of your strawberries?Oh, but my favorite:""Warner thinks Adam is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations."" wut."
94,4,"This book sucked me in from the first sentence! The short chapters did wonders for my sleep. It’s always one more chapter and then…I really enjoyed the action type scenes more than the romance between Adam and Juliette. But that doesn’t mean that I didn’t like their chemistry, I did. They were adorable and cute together but the speed of their relationship was like zoom💨 I’m a full blown girlfriend even though I hardly know the guy.Juliette was such a sweetheart and my heart broke for her at the start of the book.She had determination and grit and compassion which made *clears throat* 𝘴𝘰𝘮𝘦 𝘱𝘦𝘰𝘱𝘭𝘦 madly in love with her.[*wags brows* YEAH WARNER IM LOOKING AT YOU.]Warner is the bane of my existence even though he had such a short stint in this book. He’s a lil psycho and I love him. I can’t get over his declarations! Like wait he really said that?! And the way he ᑲᥱggᥱძ in chapter 27 made me wanna cry for him. The way his emotions flitted across his face and she saw them all JAHSJFHJD“Warner, come to me, *beats a fist to my chest* “look at me. Forget about Juliette. I’M HERE FOR YOU!”AGH don’t get me started on chapter 39. He was the shit. Brooo I cannot believe that she actually followed through with her plan!! Like she did what she did and fr said c’est La vie.Mafi gave me plot twists I actually didn’t see coming and I absolutely LIVE for that. That first plot twist gave me a kind of hurt I never wanna experience again (but I secretly want more 🤫)Also the way she got me so attached to these characters in only 50 pages makes me so much more invested in this series. And her metaphorical sense is so relatable it makes me feel seen.Adam is so cute. I’m rooting for Warner but Adam has been nothing but adorable yet. What goes wrong?!That ending left me kind of unsatisfied but I’m sprinting to the novella.Side note:The diversity in this book was amazing to see!Also I don’t like B̶l̶o̶n̶d̶i̶e̶ Winston. I give you permission to convince me otherwise.Songs:Shattered - backstreet boysShattered heart - BrandySoul sucker - ElliseGenie in a bottle - male cover by OSHRIWaterfalls - JOY.Highnote - E.

95,4,"Okay guys, this lived up to the hype.!!MINOR SPOILERS!!Let's talk about the characters. First off, I've heard multiple people call juliette a ""pick-me girl."" WTF. Just because she doesn't carry a fancy sword or have attitude it doesn't mean she isn't strong. Some women really be like ""girls support girls"" then bash a book character every time she isn't a ""strong female."" Like, Juliette is scared for life, locked up in prison, away from her family, being sued to torture people, and killed a little child on accident. What do you want her to do, skip around the room like a manic pixie dream girl? She is human you know. She's just not your definition of it. I loved her. Because as flawed as she is, she's endured so much. She didn't let anyone break her, and she always had hope.Now Adam. *inhales deeply*, I don't know what to think of this guy. I don't love him, but I don't hate him. He's nice, is what I'll say. Although he's kind of going through a ""mal phase."" Treating Juliette like she's a weak fragile bird, and it kind of gets on my nerves. I like overprotective men, but only when they know the girl is just as capable as they are.Now AARON FUCKING WARNER. Y'all, this man blew me away. He also blew this million dollar pussay if ya know what I mean. I was going fucking feral for this god of a man. He treated Juliette like the queen she is and I am so here for it. He gave her dinner, he searched for her, killed for her. he is on his knees for this girl, and I love it.And Kenji. AAAAAA. Kenji is the Altair of Shatter Me. Tall? Check. Dark? Check. Handsome? Check. Snarky? Check. He checks every box in my questionnaire for a potential bf.And the writing. it was very weird at first, but honestly it's clever. Juliette is in a fragile and weak position and the writing made me understand that. She feels like she's slowly spiralling and the way some phrases were crossed out and repeating and being denied showed me how scared she is.The pacing, though, was a bit quick. A little too quick. It felt like insta love for Juliette and Adam instead of that angsty denial-then-acceptance relationship for Juliette and Warner. That utterly convinced me. enemies to lovers isn't just about degrading a woman and fucking her like she's a mutt. It's about back and forth arguing, differentiating opinions. You truly know people are mean't to be with each other when they have geniune arguments about each other, and quarrel. Juliette and Warner had that, and I loved both of them for trying to see each others side. For Juliette and Adam, it felt to easy and quick. There was no angst or arguing. They got over their dynamics quickly, and it felt rushed.FOUR STARS"
96,4,"Absolutely incredible. Shatter Me is a novel that I will not soon forget.What makes this novel so unforgettable. If I had to pick one thing it would be Mafi’s writing. Her depiction of Juliette’s voice is utterly captivating. There was one question that I battled with this entire novel and it’s the same one that Juliette asks herself. Who is she? To be in the mind of a character like that was absolutely shattering! (Pun intended.)This novel has a bit of everything. I wouldn’t necessarily describe it solely as a dystopian novel. There is a strong love story as well as a supernatural twist. All of my favorites wrapped up into one breathtaking debut.Shatter Me has all the elements that make a novel, a great novel. Superb writing, realistic and dimensional characters, an intense story and a gorgeous cover. The cover doesn’t really make the novel a great one, but I had to throw that one in there. Initially I wasn’t all impressed with this cover. My first thought was another one? The finished product with the foiling, it won me over.There was not one thing that I didn’t like about this novel. Although, I could have used a little more Adam!You might like Shatter Me if you like: Veronica Roth & Lauren DeStefano."
97,1,"Questo libro si guadagna il primo posto nella classifica dei libri peggiori che io abbia mai letto. Non solo perchè la trama è inconsistente e frutto di un collage tra X-Men, I fantastici 4 e Divergent, ma anche perché l'autrice usa molti termini in maniera errata.Leggendo il romanzo si individuano frasi costruite ""incollando"" a caso parole tra loro o termini tratti da ""modi di dire"", le metafore costruiscono immagini incongruenti con il significato da esprimere (es. i petali di rose che cadono,galleggiano e rivestono di un mantello ecc...).I sentimenti della protagonista sono descritti in maniera amplificata ed esagerata.Nomi e aggettivi ripetuti tre volte insieme con le frasi barrate soprattutto nei dialoghi sono insopportabili, distraggono l'attenzione del lettore dalla ""vicenda"".Scrivo ""vicenda"" perché ogni minima azione è poi seguita da un'interminabile pippa mentale della protagonista, un collage di frasi fatte.A parte le due o tre scene d'azione il resto è una noia mortale."
98,5,"This book lefty me breathless, beautiful writing, a very unique story, with brilliant amazing characters.I don’t know why it took me so long to read this book, I was NOT disappointed.We follow Juliette POV, and OMG is just so good.She has been told that she is nothing more then a moster, someone who should be locked up in a prison for what she had done.I find beautiful how she doesn’t change for anybody, she’s very true to herself.Warner, my love, every time you are there, I’m like :MINE I LOVE YOU FOREVER!Adam I’m not a fan, since the start I didn’t like him that much, and then he broken Juliette’s heart the moment he meet her, I DON’T LIKE YOU ADAM.Juliette and Warner have so much more chemistry, better conversation and so much more.Juliette and Warner, my baby’s, LOVE YOU TO DEATH.=> And I’m that person that loved Warner since the moment he appeared with those freaking beautiful green eyes!!

100,1,"First of all, I want to apologize to my bookish friends who adored this book, I tried. REALLY TRIED. But I've never been so wrong about a book before and the struggle is just so real..Before continuing though, I want to say this: Shatter me is a terrible first book in a series that might be really good. I wouldn't even say that I don't understand why people loved this because I DO (i think). But I do think that it's not for everybody. This is me the first half:Then when I'm closer to the end:In between:There. That's my meme representation of myself.. And here is why it came to that.It doesn't have any. Let's move on. ....kidding! There is, of course. It's poorly executed though. I personally think that this book would be better if they're in a YA contemporary romance genre. And I just noticed something, this is from my experience and I don't know if you've had a similar experience but most of the time when I ask some people who loved Shatter Me what the book is about, I get more raves about the love triangle. Maybe I should have taken that as a hint already. And  I can't even believe that some mentioned that if you love Hunger Games, this should be your next read. Don't even compare it. Although this novel has a dystopian setting and has been marketed as such, the world- building of the novel isn't fully thought out. There are a couple of paragraphs mentioning the problems of the world and the government that now controls it, but they feel hasty, like they were added at the suggestion of the editor at the last minute. I would definitely call this a romance novel that happens to be set in a future society. Let's start with Juliette, our heroine and the narrator of the story. Well, to be completely honest, I wanted to smash Juliette's head in with a baseball bat. See? See what Juliette is doing to me?! She's always surprised, startled, gasping, choking and aching. Aching in her joints, stomach, skin, eyes, eyelashes and there's always something in her throat like a reptile or cottonballs and her jaw is always dropping on the floor. Sometimes, it's even dangling in her shoelace. Oh and she says things like this: Stuff like this too: I swear, Juliette is making me a violent person. And probably my favorite:I tried to symphatise, to even put myself in her shoes, I even considered the possibility that maybe she is crazy. You know, legit crazy. But no.. she still think properly at some point in the book. As a character on the brink of being driven insane by loneliness and starvation for human touch, she had a lot of potential . Again, not executed very well. I understand her actions at the first few chapters, but when she came out of that cell she's been holed up into, I was expecting some character development. Like, c'mon Mafi! Just some, leave your metaphors for a while and focus on Juliette. But in the end, I still haven't got any. And if you're talking about this being a character development, I'd say NO. Now Warner, is a completely different story. Not because I like him or I'm swooning over him, but because he's a mean and crazy and he made me scared a little. I still don't know if he's a genius or a lunatic.. BUT I'M ROOTING FOR HIM. I hate that he's inlove with Juliette who is a whiny, emotional wreck who just never seems to grow a pair and rise above.The most frustrating and hated thing about the book is the writing. I adore Mafi, I really do. At first, I thought that the strike troughs are very unique and I was actually excited for it. But then it got annoying and I wasn't enjoying anymore. Then I found myself asking.. WHAT IS THE ACTUAL PURPOSE OF DIZZZ. And I'm a big fan of prose and poetic writing but  metaphors are effective if they're done well, and in the hands of a masterful writer they can be nothing short of glorious. That just isn't the case here. They're distracting, over-used, and, in many cases, downright nonsensical. They make the entire book feel melodramatic, like a creative writing class gone wrong. I know I'm a horrible person because of this but ever since I've read this book and I'm feeling down, I read some passage from the book and have a chuckle. It's just too much, you know? To the point that it doesn't make sense anymore.And I love you guys, but to those who are asking if I will continue the series, I'm having second thoughts about it. I'm glad you guys enjoyed this, really.color: #000000;blockquote"
101,4,"4.5/ 5⭐0/5 🌶️I order the Fairy Loot Exclusive Lux box set and these books didn’t disappoint, they are gorgeous. I really enjoyed this storyline. Loving Juliette, Adam and Kenji and the plot is developed well. I am also invested in Warner, he is giving me Damon Salvatore vibes and I am here for it!! This series is the perfect dystopian, fantasy, sci-fi, with a splash of ROMANCE book. It was beautifully written. I love the repetition. I love that it’s written like a diary entry. It’s poetry..Quotes:“All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”“Hope is hugging me, holding me in its arms, wiping away my tears and telling me that today and tomorrow and two days from now I will be just fine and I'm so delirious I actually dare to believe it.”“His eyes are two buckets of rainwater: deep, fresh, clear. Hurt.”"
102,3,"2022 Reread: 3 starsListening to the audiobook made this a bit more tolerable. I was able to just zone out during the paragraphs of moronic metaphors. (Alliteration. See? I can use literary devices too. 🙄)Also probably helped that I knew in advance this time how annoying the writing was going to be.(I’m only rereading this because fanart on Instagram tells me I was correct in who I originally rooted for. He’s still the only interesting character in this book. I also suffer from book FOMO because I am an idiot.)I’m also keeping my originally review below because I stand by all of it. ALL OF IT. What in the hell editor approved this terrible pacing and ridiculous AF writing? WHO DID THIS TO US?!tl;dr—The audiobook is the way to go on this. I recommend 1.10 speed because the reader’s pace is slow (for my taste, anyway). She also has sort of a babyish voice, but it’s still lightyears better than the alternative.—————————————————————Original 2019 Review: 2 stars(I read the physical book here.)I knew this wasn’t going well when I started actively avoiding reading it.I can pinpoint the exact place this book lost me:COME ON. I can put up with a lot of stupid metaphors, but THAT was too much.The characters are REALLY bland. The MC, whose name I’ve literally already forgotten and have to look up right now...Okay, the MC, JULIETTE, is dull. Think white bread without butter or jam or even the crust. Better yet, think of cardboard.Her insta-love interest is no better. (I’ll be honest—I’m anti-insta-love, so I should have just stopped when that hit. But dammit, I was committed.) I kept sort of hoping he’d disappear somehow.Probably not a good sign when I spend the entire book rooting for the villain/hoping the villain kills the main characters off. Said villain was the only interesting character in the book, but didn’t have much screen time. Sad.Lol, what’s that?Big nope.AhahahahahahahaSee below.andandWhat. The fuck. Does any of that mean?The world may never know."
103,5,"I just re-read this book and I still feel the same way even after all this time!First I would like to say that I'm writing this review for the whole Shatter Me series. That being said here's my review of the shatter me series.Breathtaking, wonderful, stunning.... I could use any of those words to describe this series but they would all be understatement.Mafi's writing is beyond refreshing and unique. It's something so hard to describe or even put into words, and I know that my review wont do it true justice.I found myself drowning in her words and not wanting to come up for air. I wanted the waves of her writing to crash over me and pull me further and further out. I'm pretty sure I held my breath the whole time I was reading this series (which might I add I finished in less than two days).Since finishing this series I have found myself comparing any book I have read or am reading to it. Never has a writer made me fall so in love with characters and made me feel like whatever happened to them was happening to me. Her characters will steal your heart and soul. Juliette will make you feel empowered and brave. Adam will make you remember what love feels like. Warner will show you everything you secretly want and OH BOY WILL YOU WANT IT, and Kenji will be the friend you've always wanted.I could go on for ... ... no years about this book. I would go so into detail and fine tooth comb and break down every chapter if I could, but I wont because I would never want to tarnish, or give out any details to someone who hasn't had the chance to read this masterpiece, because that's what this series is. It's the Mona Lisa of ya novels. A slight mysterious smile that you can't turn away from. It makes you want to scream out loud and kiss Tahereh's forehead and thank her for writing something so on point. so on point.I could seriously keep going, but I'll spare you the novel of a review I could write and leave you with this.....You know how you meet someone with such passion for what they do and all you can think is ""wow, this person was born to do this""Read this review and other one our blog:"
104,5,"An Advanced Reader Copy was provided by the publisher for review. Quotes have been pulled from an ARC and may be subject to change.Juliette has the power to drain people's lives with one single touch. (Think Rogue in the first X-Men movie.) She's not one to be submissive when the handsome blonde-haired, green-eyed Warner captures her and tries to use her as an experiment. He's the evil, oh-so sexy Captain that Juliette detests, and yet is attracted to, at the same time. As you keep reading, there are little hints he may not be all that he seems. *swoons*Then you have the good boy Adam Ghent, Juliette's childhood best friend. His love is legit, and real and you can tell the moment they fall in love. I love, love, love the snippets of the past. It just gave the book credibility because the character development was on point. Their relationship was incredibly heart warming and that you can't help but to say ""awwww.""It was no surprise Juliette was loving how she is attracted to both the bad boy and good guy. (What warm-blooded female human wouldn't be?) You can just feel the characters' passion leap right off the page. Teenage hormones or not, it was definitely captivating and not to mention romantic as heck, the romance factor scored off the charts!Yes, there's a bit of a love triangle happening but it was balanced out with lots of action! So we have the love triangle going on, but what about the action? Oh indeed there's action. I can't reveal too much without spoiling the story, but seriously, this is a must-read. I loved it so much that I couldn't put it down! I read the whole thing in one sitting!Tahereh Mafi writes with such lyrical prose that is incredibly original than most authors that I can't wait for the rest of the series."
105,4,"Just... WOW.I can't put into words how much I loved this book. It was AMAZING. And wow, WOW, I remember I just read the first page and since there I was hooked and fascinated by Tahereh Mafi's writing. I fell in love with her style, so much like poetry, such a way with words! I think I highlighted almost every line in this book and really, in some of them I had to pause and re-read because of their depth!About the characters, I love to be inside Juliette's head, she's kind of crazy (not at all) and I really like the way she thinks. Also, the love story between Adam and her is adorable, but I don't know, I'm not really fond of them yet... maybe in the next book? I'm not sure.I just want to say I love Warner. I know he's twisted and he's the villain, but I can't help to find him intriguing! I can't wait to read more about him in the next book. Every page with his presence made me uneasy and happy at the same time, and I was yelling out loud things like: YOU BASTARD, HOW COULD YOU I LOVE YOU. Or: WARNER SON OF A--- OMG I WANT TO HUG YOU.YES...And the ending really left me wanting more, I'm going to start Unravel Me tonight!"
106,3,"“Touching him is all I want to think about”I just need a minute because I’m still trying to comprehend what I just read. I literally have almost nothing to say other than, “why didn’t I read this sooner”😭 😭.This book is EVERYTHING. Starting with the main characters, I just love Juliette, honestly she’s such a badass with a strong mind and her compassionate trait. She is probably one of the strongest MC’s I’ve read about in a while, and honestly it was just so so refreshing. Then there’s Adam who I just adore. Him and Juliette are EVERYTHING, like they are so strong together I love it.And now there is Warner… now my thoughts on him are like all over the place. There were times where I was like “he’s a dick” but then there were moments where I was like “why is he so caring all of a sudden”. I’m picking up something with him and Juliette so I’m interested to see where that leads. AND THEN there’s Kenji, who is just the best, starting from his personality to his humor.“I am not insane. I am not insane. I am not insane…”And now onto the plotline of the story and all that, I honestly loved the whole idea of the book. The plotline really grabbed me from the beginning and I’m just praying they don’t drag this along for 6 books and it gets super interesting. Not saying that this book wasn’t interesting, because it definitely was, but hopefully the storyline doesn’t drag on for the entirety of like 6 books. Other than that, the ending was just amazing and I’m so excited to see where this leads to!!"
107,4,"4★OMFG… I enjoyed this way more than expected. In the beginning i was kinda of like ummm is this this what yall have been obsessing over this whole time? But then then the magic happened and I became one of them😩The start of this book was so sad and raw. I also really had to get used to this writing style but eventually I got used to it and loved it.I won't lie about it but I actually liked the action scenes more than the romance ones I don´t know but they gave me so much adrenaline while reading them. But, but, but I do like Adam and Juliette together I don't get why everyone is hating so much on him. He's so sweet towards her. I guess I have to find out myself.Warner better get some good ass character development. But I won't act like I didn't like him obsessing over Juliette, it's kinda cute🤭Some of my fav quotes/lines:"
108,1,"Shatter Me is only beautifully written if you think the following is beautiful writing:“Summer is like a slow-cooker bringing everything in the world to a boil one degree at a time. It promises a million happy adjectives only to pour stench and sewage into your nose for dinner.”“Hate looks just like everybody else until it smiles. Until it spins around and lies with lips and teeth carved into the semblance of something too passive to punch.”“His eyes are tight, his forehead pinched, his lips his lips his lips are two pieces of frustration forged together.”“My heart is a water balloon exploding in my chest. My lungs are swinging from my ribcage.”“I hate the lackadaisical ennui of a sun too preoccupied with itself to notice the infinite hours we spend in its presence.”I hate writing reviews for books I don’t love, and this one is especially hard because the author is so funny and seems so nice online. But unfortunately I can’t recommend this book. The book has so many problems and doesn’t even read like a real novel. The characters are very flat and the writing is overdone and repetitive. The worst of it is nothing really happens.Juliette, the main character, has a deadly touch and is in an asylum at some time in the future. Then the guards give her a cellmate, a guy named Adam, and the poor girl who has been isolated for her entire life and locked up for 264 days falls instantly in love with him. The reader is told that sparks fly and Juliette is very attracted to her handsome cellmate, but I didn’t feel it because I didn’t know either character or know why they were even in love. There was no connection. When they are let out of the asylum because Adam is a solider working for Warner, the villain, Juliette is held captive in his palace place. Nothing really happens there either, except her and Adam getting close to kissing and being interrupted by something many times. You find out Adam and Warner are both immune to Juliette’s deadly touch and then they break out and end up in a school for other people with powers and thats the end.This book does not remind me of in any way. Juliette is not even close to as strong or independent as Katniss. When Adam appears, he is all she ever thinks about. There are no action scenes in this book and there is no mystery to figure out or tension to find out what happens next. I would say that this book is much closer to X-Men since it gets pretty comic-bookish in the second half of the novel but it’s missing all the heart."
109,4,"They think I’m a doll they can dress up and twist into prostration. But they’re wrong.I've heard good things about Shatter me, so I read this book with good thoughts, and I certainly wasn't disappointed, it was very enjoyable read indeed. The storyline was interesting and easy to read that I just loved it so much, and couldn't put it down. The story follows Juliette who has a *gift* superpowers, She can kill people just by touching them. She has been locked up for years. Her family abandoned her. She hasn’t touched anyone in exactly 264 days. And now she’s been released, The Reestablishment wants to use her as a weapon to torture and kill all the rebels. I can’t believe I waited so long to read this book. I’m so late to the party ,I know. But I’m really glad I gave this book a shot.These are some of my favorite quotes:PS: I really love The cover. It’s AMAZING!All in all, This book captured my heart. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves YA Dystopian novels."
110,5,"""...I only know that the scientists are wrong. The world is flat. I know because I was tossed right off the edge and I've been trying to hold on for 17 years.""Juliette's touch is toxic and deadly. All her life she's done nothing but try to behave, to keep to herself, be small and quiet, so she doesn't hurt people. But now two sides of a warring nation are after her and her abilities, and she is forced to come to terms with her powers.I LOVED Juliette as a character. I feel like a lot of times female MCs are either total divas or fluffy pink airheads and there's no in-between. Juliette is the perfect Goldi-Locks MC, she's kind and quiet, but not naive. Powerful but not arrogant about it. I am liking her so far.The chemistry between her and Adam is At this point in time, I cannot understand the appeal of Warner at all, I mean, he's a psychotic fascist murderer who has literally stalked Juliette her whole life, how is that attractive.I guess that's the one part of this book that I really don't get so far, the love triangle. I get that Warner is supposed to be attractive or whatever, but as previously stated, he is a psychotic fascist murderer stalker and I just don't see the appeal. Also, he literally tried to murder Juliette's boyfriend several times... I just... I just don't understand why she can't stop thinking about him all of a sudden.Anyways.I can't wait to read unravel me!! Happy reading and Happy New year (:"

A plan that Juliette wants no part of...So, I still don’t like Warner😑But more on that later!I know lots of people hate the , the repeating repeating repeating, and how the numbers are written.But I loved it?I’ve seen people say that the author’s trying to be ‘different’ by writing this way, but I don’t see it like that.I see it as Juliette.Juliette, who’s had no control over her life, who doesn’t know what’s going to happen to her, Juliette who’s trying desperately to understand, to keep track of her surroundings.I see the constant counting as a way Juliette understands things, as a way to keep herself calm—don’t we all count our breaths when we’re worried?—as a way to perhaps control one part of her life.The repeating? When you read it, Juliette only repeats information when she’s trying to understand it, to understand her thoughts and feelings.And the crossing out? It’s almost her inner monologue, the voice inside her head she’s trying to ignore.So, I like the writing—even the similes and metaphors.What I don’t like is some other things;Mostly Adam (hate him)Juliette’s kind of irritating?There needs to be more world building because I have so many questions!AND WARNER. This man better have one HELL of a redemption arc, or I will be sticking firmly to my no-warner side (sorry Lila and Gamar—but maybe I’ll like him more soon?)It has potential, so I’m going to continue my reread (mostly for KENJIIIIII)———Characters ———Juliette: I mean, she’s kind of annoying? (Mostly because she’s pining over adam🙄) but I might like her more further in.Kenji: my favourite character. He’s so funny—even in this book before he and Juliette become friends.Adam: oh fuck off. If he and Warner are her only options, I guess I would take Warner.Warner: okay he’s coming across as kind of creepy? I can’t remember anything so maybe he gets less creepy???————Quotes————“Just to feel something.Just to feel human.”“It’s nearly impossible to beat gravity when no one is willing to give you a hand.When no one wants to risk touching you.”————Songs————-AViVA-Ruelle———Random extra thoughts———I’m sorry, this was basically a tangent about how much I liked the writing 😖Thanks for reading!❤️—————————————Lila and Gamar practically threatened me into this reread."
112,4,"His touch is scorching my skin through the layers of fabric and I inhale so fast my lungs collapse. I’m caught in colliding currents of confusion, so desperate so desperate so desperate to be close so desperate to be far away. I don’t know how to move away from him. I don’t want to move away from him.I don’t want him to be afraid of me.Seventeen-year-old Juliette Ferrars has spent the last three years imprisoned. Because of her unique ability to kill a person with a single touch, The Reestablishment has taken her from her non-caring parents and locked her in an asylum where she hasn’t seen another human being or spoken out loud for 264 days. She would know - counting is what she does to stay sane.One day the door of her cell opens and a boy steps inside, a boy Juliette knows very well. The two of them have trouble trusting each other at first, but just as they manage to form a weak bond, Warner, one of the leaders of The Reestablishment, comes to take Juliette away, determined to turn her into a powerful weapon. Warner’s obsession with Juliette and the fact that she’s literally untouchable are the only things keeping her alive. Forced to choose between dying and killing other people for The Reestablishment, Juliette will do anything to find a third option, one that includes the boy she’s always loved.I had no trouble picturing the world Tahereh Mafi created. In fact, when I try to think about what’s coming, that’s pretty much what I see. (I’m not exactly an optimist.) Terrifying soldiers in grey uniforms, grey concrete under a grey sky. Food rationing for everyone except for the privileged few. This is where I think she did an excellent job.Ordinarily, I view decorative writing as something worthy of admiration. People like Maggie Stiefvater open up new worlds for me, or at the very least add colors that my eyes, until that point, refused to see. But there’s a huge step between poetic prose and beautiful-sounding nonsense, and I’m afraid Mafi crossed the line quite a few times. There were sentences that just didn’t make any sense, no matter how lovely they sounded. On the other hand, there were parts that simply took my breath away, and I loved how innovative and bold the writing was as a whole. All the repetition gave it an interesting rhythm, and the striked out text helped us understand Juliette’s inner conflicts.I can’t wait to find out what these characters will do next.For this review and more, visit"
113,5,"Title: Shatter MeBy:Tahereh MafiMy Rating:5/5REVIEW: This book is something so powerful it had me intrigued by the first sentence. i finished this book in a day which is rare on my part lol(slow reader) I loved everything about this book, even though it is rather similar to X-men and the character Rouge. Juliette was placed in an asylum after an incident that occurred and ended with the death of a child. juliette hasn't been touched in over 265 days until she meets Adam, a familiar face that ends up being her ""Roommate"" but he's keeping something from her and so is she...I loved how beautifully written this book was, Tahereh made a world that is shockingly thrilling and i just cant get enough. I really liked how all the scratched out words were her subconscious saying everything she was holding back to say or thinking of, and her OCD with numbers throughout the whole book i was thinking to myself ""damn she would of been a mathematician in another life"". I recommend this book to everyone and am certain that anyone would enjoy this book. This is most definitely going into my Fave-5-star-books!"
114,5,So glad I finally read this book. I adored every second of it
115,2,"SHATTER ME : a bland blend of dystopia and romance but mostly romancethis was a re-read because i wanted to torture myself read a wildly popular YA series.let me get that straight. shatter me is not a dystopia. my 16 y/o self went thinking it was and poor girl, she suffered.but i am smarter now and i know shatter me is a romance but the romance is still bad, so once again, i suffered.BUT a major difference was i actually enjoyed it more than i did last time around. couldn't care less about love triangle but warner had his moments. before he became all drama queen, i thought he was going to be this morally gray, messed up villain who would make me question my last remnants of morality but no *sobbing*Warner shooting that soldier without hesitation was HOT. Warner being obsessed with power was INTERESTING. Warner being romantically obsessed with juliette was BORING *boo*but warner's homicidal tendencies are still there so i still have HOPE lmao.Adam is just there. he is the safe, bland love interest. he has hardly got anything going on beyond that.Juliette, i swear, only has two thoughts -1. ""omg i am a monster""2. ""warner/adam is HOT ""Kenji made me laugh the most. he is by far the best character in here.James is cute and how i wish he was grown up and i was reading about him and not his vanilla brother.i can dedicate some lines to show how.. interesting tahreh mafi's writing is but the bottom line is ban the use of metaphors and similes for her🙂if you are the rare person who hasn't read this book yet, here are some examples. ENJOY."

117,3,"I was tired of the insanity of believing I was inhuman; a monster. But then I realized that what seemed a weakness was a strength. That together we could be something extraordinary. Something good.Tahereh Mafi introduces us to Juliette, who can kill people with a touch, so she is recruited for more than 264 days by a corporation nominated The Reestablishment, to avoid more damage.In the story, animals are nonexistent, all the plants are dying, and there’s a water and food shortage. The Reestablishment presumes to be in the disposition to help the society and get back what they had when they're doing the opposite. They are establishing a dictatorship.Let me start by saying the book has . But some parts are better than others. It counts with a good narrative; however, I don't understand some metaphoric connotations used by Juliette; for example, ¿HUH?I like when, at the beginning, Juliette has her notebook. It felt like we (the readers) got into her thoughts much more than the narrative. We can see as proof of her most , to proceed with the ""normal"" thoughts to herself. I didn't like it didn´t continue; I think it would have been more interesting to maintain it, even if she didn't have her notebook.One thing I couldn't stand was the repetition of words. Juliette constantly repeated three times some words, and that's not a grammatical grammatical grammatical style. I got tired of seeing it every two or three pages.Regarding the characters, I considered them well-structured. Starting with , I liked the transparency of her depression because of her social isolation and her parents’ indifference. are the couple. I just need a little bit of personality from him. Their chemistry is palpable, and I love how their relationship develops.Other characters that I loved were (the antagonist) and (Adam's friend). Warner is such a good ""villain"" that you end up hating him, and that's good writing. want to know more about his development through the saga. On the other side, Kenji is his polarization. It balances the drama with his humor.Before closing it up, I want to mention a series of honorific situations that made me cringe the hell out:Such a pretty couple, but they couldn't control their hormones when the militaries of the Reestablishment were looking for them and WANTED TO KILL ADAM? It was like:We all hate Warner in this book, even more than Juliette, so when she said I gagged.Our Juliette transforms into a full-sized Lara Croft when she tries to save Adam. She has never used a gun, but there she was, shooting and kicking asses until she found him. I mean, good for her we stan powerful women.In conclusion, if you made it here, thank you so much. I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. Does the series have potential? Probably. Will I keep reading it? Hell yes. Besides everything I mentioned, it has good properties, and what it looks for is to accept our defects and make them our strengths. And that is a beautiful message."
118,2,"I picked this up because I wanted to see what GR was always going on about but really ?? I hope this got better with the rest of the books but frankly I don’t get what all the fuss is about. I read her Emotion of Great Delight and it was a straight 5 star for me but this Shatter Me bookWhat’s my jaw was dangling from my shoelace ?????I’d come back and vent later but right now I’m fuming… okay I’m back (after months lol; this below is on 6th June , 2022, I took notes while I read in Nov 2021)The striking wasn’t even disturbing but I learnt from a reader’s review that it’s the unstable state of the MC’s mind; whatever floats your boats lolI was literally cringing with all those metaphors“My heart is racing through my blood, destroying my self-control, spinning everything into a cyclone of intensity.”Urgh what ??“There are 400 cotton balls caught in my windpipe. I look at Adam because I don’t know what else to do.”🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️🤦🏾‍♀️“His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.”“His eyebrows are touching the ceiling. ”Eh ??“His fingers are so careful. He pushes the waves over my shoulder so they won’t get caught in the zipper. Trails a line from the base of my neck down to the start of the seam, down to the dip in my lower back. I can hardly keep myself upright. My spine is conducting enough electricity to power a city. He takes his time zipping me up. Runs his hands down the length of my silhouette. “God you look incredible,” is the first thing he says to me.”Goodness !I MIGHT read the rest in the series just because I don’t like incompleteness."
119,4,"""I've been locked up for 264 days.""Holy Desperation Batman!I'm going to preface this by saying if you can't tap into some kind of angst, be it teenage or otherwise, you will probably not enjoy this book. I normally have very calm, even emotions, but the main character is simply dripping with despair. At first it was off putting until I cracked my heart open, just enough to empathize. I also had to remind myself that this was stylized as if a 15 year old had written it. We are not dealing with Shakespeare here. This is a teenage girl with a pen and a notebook. Strikethroughs are simply how she would've corrected the text.With those things in mind, I thought it was pretty damn good. Set in a dystopian world, the story is compelling, and unfortunately, feels totally plausible, considering the current state of things. The characters are distinct, and mostly likable, with the exception of the despicable villain. The world building is descriptive enough, without being overbearing or monotonous. Lastly, the pacing was nicely timed and steady. Once the introductory part is done, it becomes quite the page turner.This book is good for fans of dystopia, fantasy, or romance, however it is definitely a YA that is strictly targeted to a younger audience. Therefore I recommend it mostly to 15 - 25 year olds. Older people like me - I'm 37 - can enjoy it as well, but it takes a little more work on our part. However I do believe that the older you get, the less relatable this book becomes."
120,0,"DNF!I really did not get far through this book, the premise was intriguing and i really do think it had potential...but i really could not get on with the writing at all and honestly the main character just seemed like a moron.I usually don’t mind “flowery” writing but this was just metaphor after metaphor and I couldn’t get on with it at all. It just wasn’t making much sense to me and I didn’t feel like I could get through one more page!At least I can say I tried though I will never be trying again. I commend anyone who actually likes this book. I couldn’t even bring myself to rate it 1* cos it just felt far too generous"
121,4,"Juliette ist 17 Jahre alt und allein. Alle halten sie für ein Monster, da ihre Berührung töten kann. Sie wird weggesperrt und völlig isoliert gehalten. Bis sie eines Tages einen Zellengenossen bekommt: Adam. Sie freundet sich mit ihm an, doch kann sie ihm wirklich trauen?💖Mein Leseeindruck:Mir hat das Buch überraschend gut gefallen. Überraschend gut deswegen, weil ich bei Dystopien immer etwas kritisch bin. Aber hier hat mir sowohl die Geschichte an sich gefallen als auch der Schreibstil der Autorin. Sie schreibt sehr leicht, sehr flüssig und dabei aber auch einzigartig und bildhaft. Ich konnte mir die Welt, die Tahereh Mafi hier geschaffen hat, sehr gut vorstellen.Auch die Protagonisten Juliette und Adam haben mir sehr gefallen. Juliettes Gefühle und Ängste konnte ich sehr gut nachvollziehen. Adam ist ein sehr sympathischer Charakter, und nun bin ich einfach nur gespannt, wie es in Band 2 weitergehen wird."

124,5,ADORED THE INTIRE SERIES HOLY MOLY I WANT IT TO BE MADE INTO A TV SHOW
125,0,"i want to read this only for warner, but let’s hope i like it"
126,2,"1.5 stars(D: Dreadful)again, deceived by the beautiful cover.:I hated it. (or at least 3/4 of it)tho if the whole story was as exciting as the last 50 pages, I might've given it more stars.I read it veryyyy , or probably I feel that because the whole story was very very very very very very very veryyyyy slow pace.meh...did I enjoy? nope. at least not till last 50 pages.let me explain how much I enjoy:🔻page: 1-190: ★/5 (hated it, slow & plain)🔻page 190-260: ★(★)/5 (it was a bit, tiny little bit, better)🔺page 260-338: ★★(★)/5 (the last part was the story I was expecting.)Idk it's fair to give the book I hated so much, 2 stars (& not 1) I just know I never give +1 star just because of the ending, but Alas, this, here, was about 1/4 of the book... (& as my feeling through the end at that 25% changed.)this book drove me crazy & aggressive!-world building: ★/5🔻 Plain World - Loose societyI just couldn't see more than a deserted land with a tyrant government. I don't know what the government doing other than being dark & choking; nothing is obvious as I expect from a Dystopian society (having Factions, districts, you know what I mean?), it's just there... Idk maybe it's my problem but I guess the description of the world is not enough. or the world is just very simple, gray & plain.🔺the last pages, maybe you could say ""the turning point"" of the story, turned the world better & sensible.-Characters: ★/5everyone was so cliche, boring, shallow & 2-dimensional.🔻Annoying heroine, Juliette, queen of Whining & self-doubt❌🔻she thinks too much! doubts too much!WHAT. AN. IDIOT!🔻& she only thinks about Adam when he is in the scene, hell, I hate too much repetitive description about a guy, you already told he had blueeeeeeeeee eyes, you already told...I got it he is a pretty fit boy with great lips & skin & abs & eyesssssssss & very big deal for you, just STAHP!it's like she was melting in him & she can't control herself when she sees him. ewwwww, get a grip girl... (it was a big ROMANCE with a bit of Dystopia; I'm not a romance fan, not when it is this much detailed & unrealistic.)she was tiny little bit better at the end.🔻Adam was just.. meh... perfection cliche...I didn't care about him. & he is the only one who, because he is in love! What a Cliche...oh, that makes sense... NOT!Cliche pretty boy (without any other interesting trait) with that Cliche fairy tales exceptional point.& it is very problematic when you can't care about the main characters.also that insta love & love triangle... I can bear insta love (it depends) & I, only once, loved a love triangle because that was beautiful & seemed realistic, but for me, love triangles are very unrealistic in general. (or the ones I read was too bad built/written) I don't like them.🔺🔻Kenji was rude. but once in the end, Idk how I felt about him.🔺🔻Warner was the anchor of this boring story that made me continue. (at least in the first very boring, annoying pages) but he was a Jerk all the time & I got Bored by his a*$ demeanor after a while, because he was the cliche bad boy.everyone loves these last two, but I don't.no anchor character for now.-Writing style: ★/5I HATED the writing style, totally, completely.I wanted to throw the book at the wall every few pages.🔻Present tenses❌🔻first person view of a ❌ (I'm not against women, but 1st person present tenses narrating of the girls in YA fantasy/Dystopia are usually annoying, probably because the girl herself is annoying, but still...)🔻 I don't like short chapters & many of the chapters here were extremely too short!🔻the story actually proceeds veryyyyyyyy slowly because she thinks too much & that. was. ANNOYING! (let me make myself clear; it was not actually slow pace, there was literally NO pace! the story just paused for 2-3 or more pages because the oh-I'm-the-heroine-of-this-story-but-I-just-lie-here-because-I'm-traumatic-why-this-boy-next-to-me-is-so-handsome (""Oh my! the jawline! Oh my! Oh my! his muscles! his hair! his lips!"") was thinking. & mostly not about the past & other events to lead us how did we get at this part of the story & tell us more details about the world & rules, Nuuuuuuuuu...it should've been repetitively about her feelings!someone kill & so help me!or kill her, more like it.🔻I don't care about her thoughts. everyone/character especially the MC has own doubts & thoughts of course, but they didn't just think about it everywhere, nonstop! there is action & events in the stories! I need Action and/or exciting events make me jump out of my seat...instead ''.... (it is exaggerated but an example of how slow it could be...)🔻& so many REPEATING phrases... (the worst was damn page of 'I am not insane' (also strikethrough) in this case, I must say; you definitely ARE!)I didn't actually read all of that, but I was annoyed by seeing all that! (though I tried to read the others &... read next part)🔻& so many STRIKE texts which made my eyes hurt...Apparently the author thought it was very innovative to repeat phrases, or striking them. but I say it totally is definitely NOT. I just think it was only annoying & vain, just blackening the pages...this book could have been shorter, or could have had more events if there was less emotional descriptions or had been written more like a normal book!🔻& no inspirational, positive quotes, like 'keep going- you are strong- you can do it.' , more like having exactly the opposite of inspirational quotes, those ones like 'I'm nothing, I'm weak, I'm stupid' kind of quotes :| (except a few at the end)no funny moments either. (except only part at the end, with Kenji)one word, I hated it! (okay it is 3 words, but you got my point.)*constantly rolling my eyes*-plot: ★★/5🔻I was Bored....🔻It was...very slow🔻I think it was a large amount of slow burn romance (sickening & mostly I skipped those parts) with a tiny little bit of Dystopia (& no fantasy element, just a plain gray dystopia society). HELL NO! not my type! I skip all those parts! BRING ME SOME ACTION & EXCITEMENTS!🔺in like last 50 pages things were more exciting.-idea: ★★★/5the concept was good (I read some other stories like this, when character(s) have such a power & those were actually very interesting), but author couldn't describe the story well enough & the way she spread the story was very slow.-I abandon the series (even though I liked the end, but no)"
127,1,1.5*Video review: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kMq-6...
128,2,DNF-ing at about 20%. This book has an *interesting* writing style but I think in the end it's going to be annoying and not as good as the Divergent series?Too many dystopian young adult novels have come out in the past few years and left me feeling bored. Maybe dystopian lit just really isn't my thing?||
129,3,"UPDATE 2022:I read this in 2019, but I just found the entire review I'd written somewhere else. I'll add it here because, well... here is where I keep my reviews. That's it. Thanks for coming to my ted talk.Oh, I'll just comment on one other thing. In my review, I said I hoped the series would get better. Now I know it doesn't. If you haven't read anything of this series, I recommend you read books 1-3. These are the best ones and believe me, you'll want to meet Aaron Warner. After that, just forget there are 3 more books. Please. Pretty pretty please. I also remembered hating Warner in book 1, and reading this it sounds like I didn't. That's nice, seems like we were always meant to be. Ok, now I'm done.First of all, I love the covers in this series. They are gorgeous and I really love the concept. Having said that, I’ve heard so much about this book. People either hate it or love it, I have rarely seen meh reviews. Well, this is not a hate review. It's not a love review either. I didn’t the book, I just hated many things The beginning was interesting enough, but it progressively got worse and worse until it was a knot of cliches and plain characters.I was enjoying the first third of the book. We start the story with a girl locked up in an asylum. We don’t know why, we don’t know how, but we feel the danger, the desperation. We are told her touch is lethal, that she kills everything she touches. She is joined by a male cellmate, which is weird (deliberately). I loved this first part of the book because it’s all inside the girl’s mind, like a long reflection. It’s written poorly to show she is going a bit mad. And you start wondering. Why is he here? What did he do? What did do? Will the whole book be about them locked up? Weeeell... no. It probably would've been better if it was.When they get out I was still invested, still hoping the story would be interesting. It ended up being the same dystopic YA with the same cliches and the many things I hate about dystopian when it’s not done right. But more on that later, in the spoilery section.Juliette was likable at first, at least more likable than other protagonists in her genre, but she progressively worsened. She went from being this scared girl who was smart and knew how to cope, to being this scared girl whose feelings were all over the place and she reacted to nothing. Reacting to nothing is sadly common for female protagonists in these types of books. For the first time in these books, I found the main love interest, Adam, so boring and plain. I didn’t relate to him at all. I like Warner so much better.I couldn’t help but think of . The topic is similar, but Rhine is clever in Wither. I enjoyed the slow burn between the characters, and the love triangle seemed like it was going to a good place until the second book, Fever, where it all went to hell and the book ended up being one of the worst books I’ve ever read, but still, I applaud the first one. Shatter Me also had a love triangle and dystopic conflicts, but it felt forced and awkward.The writing was my favorite part of this book. The story is told by Juliette, and so we feel her struggles and her damage through her words. It progressively gets better, more organized and rational, and I loved to see through the paragraphs how her mind became clearer. I especially loved the very first part, when she’s all over the place. It felt raw and real, and it was beautiful.I hated the love triangle, it was the definition of insta-love in both ways. Why was Warner in love with Juliette? I think we should’ve had more time to see their relationship if we were meant to believe it, and she should’ve expressed something any kind of emotion towards him.Adam’s scenes with Juliette seemed forced, though they were less cringy than the ones with Warner. Like any other novel of this sort I have read, Juliette is petrified, doesn’t do anything, doesn’t react to anything and stuff just happens to her. And, EVERYBODY falls in instant love with her and would do anything for her. But why? Can somebody explain this to me? Why?I just hated it.Warner was my favorite character at some point because he seemed the only one being honest and making not such stupid decisions. Adam and Juliette are dumb and plain and boring. At least Warner seems real.I liked the first 100 pages or so, but when Adam and Juliette run away it all became so predictable and cheesy and just no.I hated so much about it, but the writing was beautiful and people keep saying the other books are better. I guess I’ll try the next book just ‘cause I REALLY wanted to like this and I hope it does get better, but if I had to give an opinion based on this one book, I would definitely not recommend it unless you love cheesy love triangles with characters who do dumb stuff for no good reason whatsoever and don’t learn from their mistakes. Gosh, I feel like that describes THOUSANDS of books."
130,3,unpopular opinion: but Aaron Warner is not that spectacular. lets be real we are all just lonely and he was too hyped for his own good
131,5,"To say I want to KICK MYSELF for waiting so long to read this is the understatement of the year.I fell in love with everything about it. With the characters, with the storyline, with the poetic detailed way it's written, strike-outs and all.I love picking up a book and being immediately immersed in the world the author creates. I love it even more when each and every character is so unique, so refreshing, and make me fall instantly in love with them. And this right here is one of those stories.I won't waste anyone's time with plot details, especially considering I am one of the few humans left who hasn't read this yet.Just know that I found it thrilling, addicting, found the writing absolutely stunning, couldn't put it down, and I am fairly certain this will become a favorite series of mine.Find Me On:❤ ❤ ❤"
132,2,"(my review for this series as a whole)This series has two aspects:- the romance part (2 stars for book 1, all the stars in the universe for book 2 & 3)- the dystopia part (1-2 stars)If you consider the romantic aspect, the first book is meh ('cause Adam is a clown). The romance in the second and third book though? It slaps my dudes. The quotes, the dialogues, the characters, the I BECOME THE FOAMING MOUTH GUY IN ATLA EVERYTIME I COME ACROSS SOME QUOTE DNJFHSGKFDGFDLLLLGLK.We have our mc: Juliette. Basically this was me when Juliette did anything in the first book:You just have to kinda endure her in the first one :') she's very annoying in the first book. But she becomes a much better character in the second and third book and the books become more likable too since they're from her pov.Then we have Adam. Didn't like him from the start. Don't know why he exists. Me whenever Juliette raved about him:And then *drumroll* we have ... AARON MF WARNER. The love of my life, father of my children, main cast in all of my most inappropriate daydreams. I LOVED HIM FROM THE START HAH.Every word that comes out of his mouth is pure perfection i swear. I have no idea how Juliette resisted him tbh. MERI JAAN (my life in urdu).Me when Aaron did anything:But then we have the dystopia part. And it's meh. I even forget what happens in the plot most of the times tbh. It's mid at best and sometimes i didn't even care about what was happening. The world building is also mid and honestly, it's every basic dystopia. It's not even that well thought out. The major point of attention is the romance and some plot points also only exist to drive the romance.In short, a series good for romance and it's characters but not so good for it's dystopian label."
133,5,"Rating: 5 magical & monumental stars!A world that knows her for a monsterAll she desires is to be humanI have never before read a book with such a beautifully scripted narrative, and prose which encapsulates rich, poetic and enthralling language in a dreary dystopian setting – The lexis itself symbolises the light in a dark world and the innocence of a yet to blossom young woman in a dictatorial domain with a tyrannical government who wants nothing more than to use her as a tool for torture. This book is incredibly unique in not just it's structure but in its exploration of a 17-year-old girl who has known nothing but abuse, neglect, isolation and loneliness, a girl who has been incarcerated for 264 days in an asylum and left to perish as one of societies outcasts.Time itself has become an obscure concept for Juliette. She has never been allowed a voice. She documents her thoughts, her memories, her internal monologue through a secret journal she keeps stashed in her cell – her only outlet. Juliette Ferrars has a curse: she quite literally has the power to kill with a single touch, labelled as lethal and dangerous for a curse she was fated to have and a gift which cost her her freedom.The world has fallen into entropy, nature is dying, the weather is tempestuous, animals are almost non-existent and vegetation cannot be sustained. The world has been turned into an industrial ground and people are treated as commodities, selected and prized for their strengths and the weak are either forgotten, eradicated or sent into asylums.The strike throughs in the text are symbolic of Juliette’s internal conflict, what she desires to say but doesn’t verses what she does, thoughts which are mostly born from deep insecurity from years of conditioning. She is lost, confused and copes the only way she knows how: counting, counting everything in her cell from the individual hairs on her head to the single threads in her blanket. She relies on coping mechanisms, mechanical behaviours to carry her through her emotional torment.Juliette’s journey is one of internal turbulence, redemption, hope, love, strength, crippling fear and a sliver of hope despite that fear – especially when along comes Adam Kent, a saviour or a torment, a boy that the catacombs of her memory remembers. Adam was her first love, one of the only people who fought for Juliette and saw her as an equal. Adam now works for the Re-establishment – an international government regime intent on the destruction of culture, language, human rights and identity.The world has been stripped and reconstructed into a different system of organisation, controlled and moulded to meet the needs of the Re-establishment. The Re-establishment used fear as a tool to gain the trust and devotion of the people in a dying world, they promised to fix what humans were destroying only to trap society in a huge prison system whereby the world is divided into sectors that are led by the leader of that sector. They made a promise to save only to corrupt. Juliette feels betrayed by Adam but soon learns the truth, and he offers her a choice for everything she has ever dreamed of. Juliette fights for the first time in her life with the help of Adam and together they outrun the forces intent on capturing them for treason.Whilst Juliette is in the asylum, Juliette is visited by the Commander and Regent of sector 45: Enter Warner – a tall, golden haired, green eyed soldier; pristine and deadly. He makes Juliette a proposition to give her freedom and luxury, amongst ideals that seem a dream away, in exchange for using her as a scourge to torment his enemies. Juliette must join the very side that put her in this position to begin with, the side that is incinerating the world she used to know.Warner is instantly an interesting character to meet; his sociopathic tendencies and conflicting attitudes make for an intoxicating blend of attractive antagonist. He is complex, multi-faceted and intrigued me just as much as Juliette. I found myself eager for every Warner scene! Juliette is incredibly conflicted by his contradictory behaviours, does he truly care for her or is he manipulating her? Warner claims to be helping her; that they are more similar than she would care to admit, and though Juliette does not know who she can trust, she does know that Adam is her only hope for all she has ever wanted. With no mercy, no compassion, and no sense of magnanimity, Warner has other plans.There was also a log at the end of the book from Warner’s point of view which I found to be insightful and helped me understand his mind a little better.Juliette is a refreshing young protagonist who rivals even the best of them throughout fiction with her dreams of defiance and her desire for change and acceptance despite the odds and in favour of them. She is a soft heart in a harsh world (people in my opinion that should be prized). She learns and finds the will to fight even in a world that has rejected her, that has become foreign to her and has transitioned drastically in her absence. Juliette is inspiring in just how much compassion and heart she possesses irrespective of her drowning spirit and despite her history. She wants the very thing that makes her human, though the universe mocks her, taunts her, and denies her of it: to be touched.Juliette struggles with not just her identity but with her strange ability and soon comes to understand that her gift is much more cataclysmic than she once thought. When you are treated like nothing more than a monster, what else will you believe but that very notion? Juliette has to constantly convince herself of her own sanity which indicates just how broken she is when we first meet her. All she wants is love and approval and has done nothing but fight to prove her own innocence for her entire existence, praying for her own absolution. She became a victim and that word has never escaped her, her very world is centralised around it.This book shattered me and continues to every time I read it. I think it poses a wonderful premise for young readers. Juliette’s character is one of the most relatable on a very human level – I think we can all see ourselves in her, and I know I certainly did. I have such an emotional attachment to this book series and these characters; I can never forget the moment I picked up this book, read it and realised i was holding something of a gamechanger in my flimsy grip. I knew from the very first line that I found something extraordinary and it was. Juliette instantly piqued my interest, she held me captivated by her every word as did Warner and Adam. I cannot praise this book enough and would recommend it to everybody!This book is character driven definitely, and though I would have preferred more world building as I had questions that were not answered about the why’s and how’s of the world, characters make a story for me and I could have stayed in this world for the characters alone. This is my go-to book and it's one that I always revisit just because I can never forget how I felt, my experience with reading it and the characters that i know for a fact will stay with me forever, and am slightly (majorly) in love with. This story brings forth the significance of touch and human contact, how important touch is to feel connected to another human being and the neglect that comes with the inability to have such a right can. Tahereh Mafi explores what it means to feel for the first time.'Shatter Me' is a genuinely clarifying, brilliant, heartfelt, hopeful read about a lost girl finding her way and finding herself. I would recommend it to everybody and anybody who loves to read. As a reader I find that reading is an incredibly visceral experience for me and never have I felt more connected and associated to a fictional character than I have when I first met Juliette and her anxiously furnished mind.Just like the dulcet, sweet-sounding, lilting harmony that is the narrative, S H A T T E R - M E - I S - P O E T R Y - I N - M O T I O N.Rebellion will always break out in an oppressed society and insurgence is rising…Number of times read: 7"
134,4,"""Laughter comes from living. I've never really been alive before.""°•*⁀➷This book had me in a choke hold from the very first page. I opened it up in Barnes and Noble and immediately decided to take it home. I love how things are crossed out, it really helped me relate to Juliette simply because the crossed out thoughts are anxiety and that was just a really cool way to recognize that.I loved the development of her realizing that she's not alone. That despite her inability to touch people, that doesn't mean she can't make connections. It's been a while since I've read it, and I don't know if I'll ever re-read, but what a magnificent book. An incredible start to a series.I loved every second of it.- Paige"
135,2,"Juliette Ferrars has been away from her parents for 3 years and incarcerated for over 260 days. Then one day, Adam Kent, a boy she knew as a child, appears. Thus begins an avalanche of activities that lead to Juliette escaping and learning to embrace her powers.NOTE: I received this through the Amazon Vine program.I want to clarify one thing, right off the bat. This is not a dystopian. This book is clearly a romance, set in a vaguely dystopian (i.e. highly stereotypically oppressive) society. More time is spent on Adam and Juliette canoodling than actually doing anything about the supposedly bad society around them.I didn't walk into this book expecting it to be a masterpiece, but neither did I open it thinking I would dislike it. But as soon as Adam Kent, Love Interest, appears on PAGE 3, I knew I was in for a stinker. This book is ; it doesn't even to act like it is anything other than a dressed up romance story for teens (meaning lots of steamy scenes, minus actual sex). The characters end up being boring as hell or wimps, the story is nonexistent and feels like a ripoff, and the dystopian society feels like diluted version of .Juliette is our protagonist, and God, does she have a complex. Yes, she's been captured, but she is constantly acting like a wimp, clinging to her boy toy to have him do EVERYTHING to her. Towards the end she improves, but even that feels odd. A few hours with guns means she is that much more relaxed about using them? I don't know where that came from. Also, I couldn't help but roll my eyes at how her parents were explained away, so that Juliette could be all alone. There are lots of parents who have children with disabilities that don't do what Juliette's parents did here. Again, the only reason the parents were painted as so callous, was to allow Juliette to run around and not have to explain where her parents were.Adam Kent is the most boring love interest ever. He is a set of muscles and abs, that's all. Of course he falls in love with Juliette because she is ""so selfless"" (i.e. doormat), and he wants to rush in and save her (which he is able to do with stunning simplicity at times). Some attempts, such as the inclusion of a widdle brother (who acts nothing like a 10 year old, but instead like a 5 year old--I don't make that complaint very often!), are made to make him more interesting, but all fall flat.Kenji Yamamoto made me groan. His role could be summarized as ""Comedic Horny Teenager"" (plus some handy Deus Ex Machina). He hits on Juliette, to prove to our audience that, although she doesn't feel pretty, she actually is. But somehow, what is even MORE annoying is the racially insensitive joke about his last name. Another very minor character, Winston, apparently thinks that Kenji's last name is ""too hard to pronounce, so Winston calls Kenji ""Moto"". My jaw literally dropped when I read that; I can't believe something so racially insensitive got passed the editor (even if Juliette thinks what Winston does is wrong). This doesn't belong in a book aimed at teenagers.Maybe I'm a twisted being (actually, there is no ""maybe"" in that), but I thought the only good character was Warner. Despite all his cliched 100% EVUL villain traits, I thought he was interesting and the only character to make any sense. I wanted to know why he wanted Juliette, what he planned on using her for, and what his history was (what was the bit about his mom??). Too bad the book never bothered to answer any of those questions--that is for the sequel (and you know it's coming!) to do.The story is bland. It's trying to be Hunger Games/1984 with some X-Men, but none of that really comes into play until the last 50 pages. This is why I didn't bother to mention Juliette's lethal touch ability above--sure, she angsts about it, but ultimately, her superpower doesn't help her in anyway until the very end. Also, it felt like it was ripping off --similar ""mystery"", similar ""finding an orphanage of highly talented children"", similar weird talents. In this case--and I totally didn't expect to say this--I would PREFER to read ""Miss Peregrine"" than this book. Yes, folks, I would rather read about a whiny, over-privileged brat finding a magical land and leaving his parents than read about a wimpy doormat girl falling in lust with a beefcake boy in a dystopian society.The dystopian society is laughable. I don't understand how the Reestablishment could take over and cause all these bad things in so short a time. I love how flinging around things like ""one language"", ""writing is illegal"", and ""people don't have food"" make up a dystopian society. It used to be time was spent creating the atmosphere--take a look at 1984 or The Handmaid's Tale! Both books take time and patience to build up their worlds. And neither of them had some stupid kiddie romance thrown in for giggles.The writing isn't horrible, though the metaphors most of the time don't make a lick of sense (or are buried within metaphors like a Russian nesting doll), but I was confused by some of the strikeouts. If this is a journal that Juliette is writing in (which is odd, as it is first person present--PLEASE authors, stop writing in first person present!!), then why does she mark out dialogue? If it isn't a journal--what's with the strikeouts?Oh, and what is WITH the weird cover?! It looks like a supermodel walking down a runway--NOTHING in this book bears any resemblance to this cover art!So I think it's clear I didn't like this book. You may wonder why I bothered to finish it, and I have two reasons: This was an Amazon Vine ARC, so I felt obligated to finish it, and I am a completest.If you want to read a fairly clean (no sex) romance book with a hint of dystopia, then this is your book. If you want a young adult book with a real dystopia, good characters, and an interesting story, I would skip this. Even with their individual faults, I would recommend both or over this."
136,4,"MY TOUCH IS LETHAL. MY TOUCH IS POWERFUL.I'm a bit conflicted about Shatter Me. At first, I was absolutely mesmerized by this book. The concept was interesting, the characters likable, and the writing engaging. But when I really analyzed it, it kind of lost some of it's spark. That's not to say that I didn't enjoy it, and that I won't be continuing on with the series, but there were some things that I could've done without.Juliette is plagued with the misfortune of killing whoever she touches. She's been thrown into an asylum after trying to help a young boy and accidentally touching him.With the outside world descending into chaos with a lack of food, shelter, and proper order . . . the Reestablishment is trying its hardest to keep people submissive and in fear. And now Juliette has to make a choice,It becomes apparent quickly to Juliette has had a really tough life. This girl could not catch a break.It's easy to sympathize with her. But other than that, I really didn't feel anything towards her, except annoyance in select areas. I really wanted a strong, confident character. I wanted to take action. To control her own destiny. But I feel like she just went wherever the wind blew.*sidenote* if I have to read one more time that she *gasped* at something, I'm going to cry.Oh, how that man stole my heart ♥ He's supposed to be the ""villain"" of the story, or at least one of them, but I couldn't stop drooling over him like he was going to be my last meal long enough to care.As for Adam, as long as he's out of the picture, I don't care what happens to him. I'm pretty sure I was to like him, but Warner had all my attention. I couldn't find it in myself to in Adam and Juliette's connection.I do have to admit, however, Kenji + Adam banter = ♥But I think that has more to do with Kenji's amazingness than anything Adam did.The writing was good and bad. At first, I was in love with it. The lyrical quality and its captivating effect gripped me from page 1. But then, we got into these metaphors that came one after another and . . . I don't even know what to tell you other than . . . We went into these complex explanations about rain and blushing that was completely and just a overdone.The world-building was great, though. I was really convinced of what was happening and had a clear picture of this dystopian world. The fear, uncertainty, turmoil . . . I could feel it. Which made much more believable and engaging.Despite all these not-so-good-qualities, I really did enjoy the book. This is one of those moments where, I noticed these things but they didn't really take away from my overall enjoyment. Yes, there is room for improvement but, all in all, it was a pretty good read, which is why I'm rating it 4 stars and eagerly awaiting starting book 2 in book I heart Warner t-shirt."

138,2,"2022 rereadwelcome to elle's new series, named: seasonal depression is hitting so hard right now so i am trying to cure it by revisiting books i loved in my childhood.rereading YA as a 22 year old is genuinely weird because when i was reading this as a fourteen year old i was like ""wow warner is 19 that is so old and mature"" and now i'm like ""he's 19 that is almost a CHILD""but other than that, this series is 2010s YA at its best: a dramatic heroine (""my shaky pen is my esophagus""), insta love, a forgettable but nice first love interest, and an unforgettable, interesting villain. and so so so much fucking angst. they don't do it like this in adult fic ever.you can read 15 year old elle's very enthusiastic review down below:⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻So I finished this book within a day. And I had school.It was addictive in the best way; a fast paced, stunning page turner. The novel had subtle elements of paranormal that was just the right amount, and it created a dystopian world that was entirely realistic.I actually really loved Mafi’s writing style – it was new, emotional, and gorgeous. It was Juliette’s unique voice that made her stand out from all the female characters I’ve read about. And although many say that they did not actually enjoy her narrative and personality, I think she is relatively level headed, given the harsh and excruciating situation she has been in her whole life.On the other hand, I had a small problem with the romance. It’s not Adam per se; I loved Adam. I thought he had one of the best personalities in the book, and the way he treated Juliette and his brother was absolutely adorable, and I enjoyed every second of his appearance.However, I just felt as if his romantic progression with Juliette was very rushed and was not really explained. I get that given Juliette’s circumstances, about her not being able to touch anyone without hurting them, and then Adam coming along and being immune to her touch? She’s been deprived and craving for someone to touch her for a long time. I don’t think she’s in love with Adam, just infatuated. And it’s going to be short term (or maybe long term and just not realistic at all). But Adam’s I stared at you all the time every day in class reason for falling in love with her was a little bit ridiculous. Adam’s never had a problem with touch. I kinda expected it to be a push pull situation, but no, they both fell in love and fell hard, fast.Their romance (which was very lackluster in my opinion), prevented the actual plot of the book from shining. There were honestly not a lot of dystopian elements – I had been expecting more. I’m starting to wonder if Adam and Juliette’s romance will be the crash-and-burn kind, which would definitely make the next books far more interesting to read, as if it’s still sugar sweet in Unravel Me, there won’t be any more character progression.It’s very obvious that Juliette has post traumatic stress disorder from being tortured by The Reestablishment, and I want to know how that plays out in the next book, when she can focus more on herself than her trying to escape. I honestly think Warner was one of the most interesting characters of the book (doesn’t feel like an outright villain), and I want to know how her interactions with him will positively or negatively affect her character arc. Her development kind of fell short and stayed stagnant when she was with Adam.Other than that, I throughly enjoyed this book. The writing was lyrical & poetic and although I think Mafi sometimes overdid the metaphors, it was a pleasant read."
139,5,"4.5 StarsI first read Shatter Me back in 2013, gave it a 5 ⭐ rating, then immediately ordered the second book, Unravel Me. Somewhere between ordering it and receiving it I got distracted and, well, here it is six years later and I STILL haven't read it. I had completely forgotten what the series was even about and I certainly couldn't remember why I rated it so highly.Now I remember. Tahereh Mafi's prose is a soul-wrenching poetic jewel.So, chicks and dicks, without further ado, I present to you the words of Tahereh Mafi...➖""These words are vomit.This shaky pen is my esophagus.This sheet of paper is my porcelain bowl.""➖""The world is flat.I know because I was tossed right off the edge and I’ve been trying to hold on for 17 years. I’ve been trying to climb back up for 17 years but it’s nearly impossible to beat gravity when no one is willing to give you a hand.When no one wants to risk touching you.""➖""The sun is an arrogant thing, always leaving the world behind when it tires of us.The moon is a loyal companion.It never leaves. It’s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human.Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections.""➖I know this writing style isn't for everybody, but for me, it was something different in this bookworld of sameness and a pleasant distraction from the heavier plots that I tend to lean towards.And now, FINALLY, after six years, I am going to read my very dusty copy of Unravel Me."
140,3,"RATING: 3.5/5It's no secret that this is a very popular book, so it would have been logical to have high expectations. But after getting disappointed several times, I've learned my lesson: lower your expectations or expect nothing at all. I was pleasantly surprised with this story and I plan to continue with the sequel. It does remind me a lot of The Darkest Minds, and my experience with that series (specially with the third book) wasn't that good. I'm hoping this turns out differently.As for the characters, Juliette is actually kind of likeable. Adam is really sweet but he's sooo boring. I would rather ship Juliette with Kenji, he's funny and he has more character. Warner is crazy but at least he's interesting. Maybe I'll get to see some changes in Adam's character in upcoming books and that'll change my mind.If you have decided to not pick up this series ever, that's fine. But if you do plan to read it, I suggest you go ahead because I enjoyed it.EDIT: Ignored what I said before. You definitely need to read this! It is more than worthy at the end."

143,3,Idk whats happening but I'm obsessed with Warner and Kenji
144,1,"”I’ve been locked up for 264 days.1 window. 4 walls. 144 square feet of space. 26 letters in an alphabet. I haven’t spoken in 264 days in isolation.”Well, since this novel seems to love numbers and statistics and such, let’s play a little game, SHALL WE??!!!The number of stars this book is receiving from me (I feel I’m being generous with this one.)The number of times I added and deleted this book to my TBR because I thought I was in the mood to read it but wasn’t.The number of friends who warned me that I was in for a ride of the not-so-pleasant type (to that friend: I’m sorry I didn’t listen).The amount of people I thought were breathing down my neck and sharpening their pitchforks getting ready to attack if I didn’t like this book.The number of seconds it took me to immediately regret the decision to start this book.The amount of pages it took before we got to our first passage of the Purple Prose. And boy did it deliver.THEY’RE FREAKING RAINDROPS.The number of facial muscles I must have used to scrunch up my face while trying to decipher purple-y metaphors like this...and this...and this...The amount of wrinkles I might have acquired reading those passages alone.The number of times my cat tried to bat this book out of my hands in an attempt to tell me that she wanted outside in the pouring rain (I didn’t let her outside, but I totally should have let her bat the book out of my hands.)The number of times my parents walked by and asked me why I was reading a book with such a hideous cover.The number of times my eyes almost rolled into the back of my head when I read passages such as this...or this....and especially this...The number of times I asked myself what did I do wrong in my past life to deserve me reading a book like this.The age I estimated the author to be who wrote this book, because I just couldn’t believe that someone of a mature age could write something like this.The actual age of the author when this book was published. WHY.The number of times I asked myself how in the world anyone could find either Adam or Warner so damn appealing.The number of times I muttered under my breath the word “teenagers” whenever Juliette and her man of the hour were making out.The number of times I spent trying to figure out the stupid world building.The number of times I said, “Oh, how AWFULLY CONVENIENT.” when the only two people who are allowed to touch Juliet are the two men at the center of the love triangle.The only time I laughed in this book. This is the passage.Number of minutes it took me to STOP laughing at this passage because it was funniest damn thing I ever read because it was quite possibly the thing I had ever read.The number of people I sent a picture of this passage to for them to read and see if it was just me, or this passage was really stupid.The number of friends who replied to my text to say that yes, Katherine, this passage is indeed stupid.The number of times my best friend Lauren questioned what in the world I was doing reading a book like this.The amount of seconds it took for an immediate wave of relief to wash all over my body when I was done reading this book.The number of books and novellas left in this series that I haven’t read.The number of those books and novellas that I will be reading.The number of Goodreads friends I have that will probably be burning me alive at any minute because of my low rating (or snarky review).The amount of fucks I give in regards to this book."
145,5,4.5/5This book was even better the second time! I think I was in the right mood for this book and I cannot wait to binge read the rest of the series.

146,4,4.5 stars! loved it!!! (:
147,1,"This is, by far, the worst fucking book I have ever read in my life.And no, that's not an over-embellished hyperbole.In fact, when a book manages to suck , there's definitely more people to blame than just the author.Not only does this book lack a quality plot, it's characters are flat, ridiculous, and might as well have been constructed from cardboard paper.But before we discuss how this book managed to fail in every possible way imaginable, let's get straight to the biggest problem I had with this book:Look, I can appreciate a poetic narrative. I may not be the biggest fans of poets who write novels because they tend to be over-indulgent but there is no denying a talented writer when you see one, despite how much you dislike the subject matter.The problem with Shatter Me, to put it bluntly, is that the author has no talent with her choice narrative style whatsoever. Not only is the book over-saturated with ridiculous metaphors every other sentence, but the metaphors themselves actually hinder the message the book is trying to make.A metaphor should be used to communicate an obscure or foreign experience or feeling by using an image or phrase that is familiar and nearly universal. This book did not use metaphors to help you understand what the narrator was feeling or thinking. It used metaphors because ""metaphors are for Serious Writers and this book is a Serious Book goddammit!""Some choice examples of the kind of shitty metaphors that are sprinkled far too generously throughout this book:(She couldn't have just written ""I was shocked"" because that would have been too simple, obviously)(So the walls are…blue? Glad we had to read so many extra words for that totally useless piece of information)This narrative ""style"" fails because1. The language that's being used here make absolutely no sense2. They are used far too often to describe the most mundane of actions (a slight hesitation in speech, the colour of the walls, a facial expression) that we find ourselves asking ""Why do we care? Are the colour of the walls so significant that we have to devote an entire non-sensical metaphor to describe them?""The long-term consequence of the frequent use of (ineffective) metaphors is that the reader no longer has any sense of scale. The villain can punch the protagonist in the face and she can say, ""My face is a million exploding stars"" but it doesn't because she may have used a similar metaphor to describe the feeling of blushing.And as other reviewers have pointed out, there are so many hyperboles and metaphors in this book that sometimes it's hard to tell if something is happening literally or if it's just part of the crazy narration.I strongly believe that authors should be able to experiment with their writing styles so expand the possibilities their stories can take, but it's also their job (and the editor's job) to ensure that the style is still at communicating what it needs to. When it's no longer effective, the editor should not be afraid to tell the writer that perhaps they should try something different.Maybe this is harsh, but I honestly believe that any editor that read the muddled prose in this book and thought to themselves, ""Yeah, that reads fine"" is either incompetent or simply doesn't care about the quality of the books that get published.I'm not going to sugar coat it: Our protagonist, Juliette, is a complete moron. She can't defend herself (despite that fact that, you know, she has a LETHAL TOUCH) unless she's got a man beside her.Oh, and these are actual lines in the book:And due to the aforementioned issues with the ""poetic"" narration, Juliette also has to spend every waking moment complaining and whining about her problems and making sure she lets us know change in her mood. I was sick of her pity-fest by page 3.Now all of this is fine and dandy had Juliette actually undergone some well-written character development. She didn't have to come out at the end of the book stronger. Character development can also mean that a character gets weaker or more flawed. But regardless of what the end result is, there needs to be a believable change.Juliette at the beginning of this book is a spineless, whiny, moronic drama queen. And at the end of the novel she is essentially the same goddamn person--The last line of narration would have you believe that somehow Juliette is ""ready"" to face the challenges she's been avoiding; that somehow, over the course of the novel, she proved herself as a strong and independent heroine.But I'm not so easily fooled. What exactly did Juliette do that made her so?She discovers she's capable of some impressive feats she didn't think possible, but that doesn't change how she views herself. I mean, she, and yet the experience doesn't change the same disempowering, I-need-a-man-to-save-me broken tape recording she's always going on about.And without giving anything away, I was absolutely appalled with the subtext at the end of this book. Juliette is wearing some totally useless skintight outfit and two guys are ogling at her, telling her how ""sexy"" she looks and suddenly it's all ""omg wow im so confident and ready to face my problems now!"" even though a moment ago she felt quite indifferent to the whole situation.What are we supposed to take away from this? That Juliette, who has always been unsure of herself for practically the entirety of the book, now suddenly feels confident in herself and ready to face her problems because some guys told her she looked good? And that's supposed to be ??!No, fuck you, book. I don't think so.Meh.There was nothing surprising about this guy. He's the designated ""good guy"" in the love triangle that's not-so-subtly being set up here. He apparently loves Juliette despite the fact that they have hardly spoken a word to each other. We're supposed to believe that he loves her because some time in the distant past, he saw her do some selfless shit--another instance of telling instead of showing. Naturally, he comes with his own DIY angsty backstory to give him some ""depth"".My biggest issue with Warner is that he's essentially a heartless sociopath and yet, his character is deliberately written as to be attractive to Juliette and the reader. I'm appalled that we are somehow supposed to excuse his truly heinous actions ofand general assholery because he's hot.It's also clear that Warner has his own ""mysterious"" dark backstory that will probably be revealed in the later books to try and explain away his deplorable actions. Like, it's ok that hebecause he just has mommy issues.This guy served no purpose other than toa. make lame passes at Juliette and tell her how hot she isb. randomly move the plot forward when it got stuckAlso, can I mention here that THERE ARE NO OTHER FEMALE CHARACTERS IN THIS BOOK OTHER THAN JULIETTE.319 freaking pages in, we FINALLY get introduced to a female twins and…that's it. Nothing else is done with them. Warner's mother and Juliette's mother are mentioned. And Benny, a landlady, is also mentioned. I don't count any of these as ""characters"" because they don't make any kind of significant contribution to the story. They may as well have been flies on a wall and that, for a book that is already has such a male-dependant protagonist, is just incredibly embarrassing.This book just barely has a plot. I'm convinced that if you taken out all the angsting and whining, you could cut down about 200 pages off this novel. The few major plot events are spaced out between long, thinly veiled wish -fulfillment ""love"" scenes that make you cringe and feel a substantial amount of second-hand embarrassment on behalf of the author. When something major does occur, it usually makes no fucking sense whatsoever because the author either has no imagination or didn't put as much thought into as she should have.At one point, a bunch of characters pass through a radioactive zone and…none of them are effected in any way.But somehow, the birds are effected by pollution in the sky and are now mutated into horrible creatures.Yeah.And let's not forget how the ending just totally ripped off.It's absolute disgrace that this moronic book should get to parade around book stores posing as a ""dystopia"".George Orwell is probably turning in his grave.This is NOT a dystopia. This is, once again, a terribly written romance novel that can't even get the romance right.But in order to ""earn"" the YA dystopian genre category, this book decided to put together the following ""dystopia"":1. Environmental disasters have devolved society into a state of instability--which, ok, would have been fine were it not for the fact that the birds are now mutated creatures, flowers just don't exist, and the weather is ""unreliable""--because apparently the author has such a rudimentary grasp on the weather that she thought that it was ""reliable"" before.2. A moronic government called ""The Reestablishment"" is trying to save the day by destroying all languages ever and creating a brand new one and exercising their military control on everyone in the entire freaking world. Yes, this poorly and vaguely described regime apparently operates in every single country ever.And…that's all we know about them. Just that they are bad and we should hate them.Literally nothing else is mentioned about the economy, history, politics, education, agriculture, transportation, employment, and any other relevant thing that goes into making a world believable.I think this book is a good example of the declining quality of YA books that are being shoved out the door. In their fanatic craze to find ""the next big thing"", they've forgotten to check for actual content quality along the way. Which, you know, is probably the most important thing when you're reading a book. At least to me.If I could give this one negative stars, I would."
148,1,"Shatter Me fue un libro que por más que quise que me gustara, lo terminé detestando.“—La vida es un lugar sombrío —susurra—. A veces tienes que disparar primero.”Y... Esa cita fue lo único que me gustó de todo el libro, aparte de Kenji.Este libro es demasiado la forma de narrar en vez de gustarme; me molestó muchísimo, no sé si Tahereh se la quería dar en Patrick Rothfuss pero no le quedo para nada; al contrario, el libro me resultó más irritante y alargado, además de que la forma “poética” en la que narraba se tornaba demasiado tedioso y cansado.Una cosa que me molestó muchísimo del libro fue todo el trama. Aunque trata sobre movimientos, guerras, política, yo solamente sentí que este libro era Mientras que todo el trama trata sobre “movimientos” para iniciar una guerra, solamente se habla de ello a inicios de los capítulos, y ni tanto porque Juliette solamente piensa en los ojos y físico de Adam.Además de que el trama no se profundiza, ni dicen algún detalle de ello, lo peor fueron los personajes.es una niña (niña, aunque parece más bebé) que no piensa, además de que se deja guiar por todos, usar por todos, y es estúpida, no dice ni siquiera lo que opina, solamente se limita a asentir y aceptar lo que le digan como una buena niña. Peor aún es que Personajes así son los que más me sacan de quicio, Solamente se limita a decirle a Warner, y comerse con los ojos a Adam; además de que tres de cuatro veces en el libro llora pero dice que Gran logro.Este chico tiene las hormonas más elevada que aunque le estén disparando solamente piensa en coger a Juliette, No me gustaste Adam, un personaje vacío además de que no lo formaron totalmente, su historia, personalidad, gustos, etc. solamente está a medias en todo el libro, Adam es un personaje demasiado vago además de bobo en todo el libro, y su relación con Juliette es demasiado rara.Pero ahí no termina lo peor, Warner con Juliette, es enfermizo. Aunque Warner es el único personaje bien empleado en todo el libro, que llegue a estar obsesionado con Juliette es totalmente asqueroso, aún así no dio resultado que me gustara, ya que solamente Warner habla sobre estar con Juliette, y una vez que menciona algo sobre el trama (que creo que no hay ninguno) no se entiende nada.Pero ahí no termina lo peor, además de que los personajes son un asco, y la forma de narrar es tediosa y exasperante lo peor fue el trama.es la querida persona que narra, el problema es que divaga demasiado, tanto en los detalles para hacerlos más “profundos y poéticos” igual que en lo que piensa. En cada parte del libro cada vez que quiere decir que no dice que sí, piensa mil y una cosas para hacerse la genia cuando realmente la hacen ver estúpida, y peor aún es cuando está hablando de “sus sentimientos” y lo que “sienten” cuando la tocan; tanta prolongación solamente es tediosa y cansada y más que proviene de Juliette.Y ni hablar sobre la relación que tiene Juliette con Adam. Ya ha mediados del libro la reclama suya y la ama, por lo menos tengo que dar un aplauso ya que fue a mediados y no a inicios.No solamente actúan como un par de adolescentes calentones, sino que actúan así.Después de eso, el otro 80% del libro solamente Juliette y Adam piensan en coger, pero no solamente Adam; igual Warner.No solamente estaba violándola, sino que está enfermo y obsesionado con ella, Oh, pero eso no es todo. De la nada, todo chico que ve a Juliette se enamora de ella o la encuentra caliente, pero Juliette no puede aceptar un cumplido, no, porque está y yo no te culpo Juliette, yo no te culpo.Y ni hablar del final, me dio más risa que nada, tan X-Men todo, no, así no.fue un libro que me decepcionó en mil maneras, personajes vacíos además de insufribles y patéticos, con un trama que no dice nada además de la calentura que tiene cada uno, y una forma de narrar más tediosa que hermosa.Y como siempre... Voy a tener que leer el siguiente libro ya que odio dejar una saga incompleta."
149,1,"""All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.""Juliette's touch hurts people, and she is locked up for it. It's been 264 days that she has been locked up until she receives a new cell mate. And it's a boy.The Story- The way this is written starts off like it should be out of a journal with all the . This got ridiculously old. A good half of the book was spent basically determining whether or not the narrator is crazy.  And really I think she is. This girl went on and on in excessive hyperbole, similes, and metaphors. I am not joking. So much of the book is spent going on and on about how people can't touch her and how screwy the world is - but only in such a poetic way that I would expect from an 8th grader listening to My Chemical Romance.After spending quite a bit of time in a crazy person cell, we get out, only to basically meet another key character and learn that two boys are essentially obsessed with this girl. This had such an absurd love triangle. And the worst part was that she was so deprived of peoples touch that we got to spend a lot of hyperbole-infused-metaphorical  scenes where she drones on and on about the touch of skin and lips.I just hated this book from the very, very start. And the only thing that got me through was the thought that maybe it gets better and the fact that it was a buddy read with and . The ending is so drastically different from the beginning, that I have no idea what to expect for the next book, but not to worry because I won't be reading it. It goes from crazy chick in a cell to dystopian x-men-Doesn't happen until the last 90%. No really, like I said, we spend so much time expressing the hatred of her ""gift"" and how dreamy Adam is and how much she want's to touch him that we have no idea really what the Reestablishment is. We get that it's dystopian...very 1984 meets ""magical powers"". -I just can't even describe the people in this book. Juliette is bat shit crazy and desperate for people to touch her that even though she is in perilous danger she can barely keep her clothes on (albeit, everything is strictly PG13). Adam is sort of creepy, like here's this girl that he is obsessed with because she was actually nice to people despite how they treated her in elementary school. Warner, is DEFINITELY creepy with his possessiveness and coming on to her.Excuse me for a little bit while I go forget this all in a gallon of alcohol.-"

And I was almost certain I wouldn't like it- another dystopian romance?? BlehhhBuuuut, I've followed this author for so long on Instagram and I was so intrigued by her so I finally decided to take the plunge and I ended up really liking this book.I adored the writing. It's very poetic/metaphorical/emotional. But I also get why people don't like it- it can be really weird and confusing. In my opinion, it really highlighted the instability inside Juliette's head at the beginning of the story.The strike-throughs didn't bother me, in fact, I thought they added something interesting. They disappear as Juliette's character grows confident and strong.The story was fast-paced and I liked the ending- things turned very X-men-ish and I'm excited to see where this story goes.I didn't like the romance. Juliette and Adam were sooo insta-lovey. I get that they had history and I can even admit that Juliette's feelings sort of made sense because she was so lonely and he's the first to treat her kindly ect. But everything about them just screamed cheesy typical romance... Like Adam has always loved her and he's the only one who can touch her. Everything happened so quickly and I didn't feel like any of it was well-developed. As for Warner, I don't get his appeal. He's a creepy psychopath. Considering how much I disliked the romance, the writing is what really saved this book for me.

I'm making 2018 the 'read all the YA dystopians I've missed out on' year.I had a really hard time with the writing and the way certain things would be repeated, it sounded stupid to me when reading. I also found myself rolling my eyes a hell of a lot because oh my goodness the cringe in this book was real and it was so insta-lovey.Despite these negatives, I really enjoyed the story and am left wondering where it all goes.Although I had a few issues with it, I do think I will continue with the rest of the series at some point because I've heard the rest is a little better. I hope that's true!"

GOD.I know I'm a little late on the Shatter Me train, but now I finally understand what all the fuss is about!This was sooo good, it took me only about 4 hours to finish the entire book, which is crazy, even for me.The way this book is written is really unique, with the striked out lines and a looot of metaphores! I'm really glad I read this book in English because I don't think it'd be half as good when translated.The writing style really made me feel for and relate to Juliette, I could litterally feel her pain and want and hurt. All the characters are just so deep and different, all likeable and relatable, even the supposed bad guys. I still don't know whether to ship Juliette with Adam or Warner, she has amazing chemistry with them both!I guess the other books will point that out though.The whole dystopian background really made me think about the earth and all the conflicts and pollution happening right now, and it really scares me! It all seems really possible to me and it makes this book extra thrilling.With that said, I'm off to read the next one right now, I simply can't wait anymore!I really hope this series continues to be awesome :)"
158,3,that was...fun. but I really wish Julliete would stop being such a baby and join Warner in his psychotic ideas for destroying the world. :)
159,1,"""I am a raindrop.My parents emptied their pockets of me and left me to evaporate on a concrete slab.""They say there's a first time for everything so it's my first time I DNF a book. I can't believe it took me this long to understand life is short, amazing books are out there and I need to read them right now (Just finished , go and read it now!)I'm not DNFing this because of the writing style, , I'm dropping this because the writing style was poorly executed. I think I get what Mafi was trying to do but she failed, delivering a speshul snowflake for a character that was too stupid to be alive, a kid for a villain and a love interest equally dull. Love Triangle? Not a toughy one, both guys were were were stupid.The more I read, the more it felt pretentious, boring, predictable and I had to stop it there because it was obviously not working for me.I better go read Outlanders' book #2"
160,0,Re reading4.75
161,3,"About those three red stars preceding this review: it’s probably best to take them with a grain (or a handful) of salt.Because while I eventually settled on 3 stars, I feel like I’m being simultaneously rather generous and also meanly tight-fisted. Which roughly translates to: there are things I enjoyed immensely about Shatter Me, and things that made me roll my eyes and groan, so my rating is a total cop-out.At an unnamed point in the future, when the world appears to have gone to hell in a handbag (and doesn’t it always?), we meet Juliette alone in a cell. She hasn’t touched another person for 264 days. She is a prisoner of The Reestablishment (sinister totalitarian-type regime that has some fairly insane ideas about how the world should be run). She’s teetering on the edge of her sanity, living at some point in the middle of her past, reality and her imagination, when her jailers thrust a roommate into her cell. And the kicker? The crux of the whole story? Juliette is capable of inflicting pain, even killing, with her touch. The story escalates fairly rapidly, from the interruption of Juliette’s cell-bound musings by the arrival of her unexpected companion, to the ramifications of Juliette’s ability and the plans the Reestablishment have for her.I’m not fond of labeling certain books “guilty pleasures”, as don’t believe in feeling guilty about reading, but I’ll go so far as say there was something indulgent about the experience of reading . It was entertaining, it was deliciously escapist – I ate it up in much the same manner that I did . However, if I delve too deeply beyond this shiny layer of good fun, I’d start poking enough holes in it that it might completely perforate my “like” for it.I can’t review this book without mentioning the writing, as I’m almost certain that this is going to be a major sticking point for some readers. That Mafi seems to have a beautifully vivid imagination and an unusual artistry with her word-use, is clear. The prose of is riddled with metaphors and imagery. Heavy with it. Particularly during the first half of the book, Juliette/Mafi seem to speak in a language of lyrical descriptions, the literal and the symbolic pressed together into dramatic, graphic figures of speech.But this is where it gets murky for me. I do love descriptive, lush writing. And there were certain lines and passages in that I appreciated for their evocative and unusual beauty. There are points where Mafi finds a striking way to express her characters’ actions and emotions, and Juliette’s stream of consciousness, that separates this book from it’s first person POV contemporaries.But the writing in is so purple, its basically aubergine. There are lines that are so convoluted and thick with superfluous descriptors as to render them almost meaningless. Lines that sound pretty, but actually jerked me out of the story by forcing an abrupt “Excuse me, ” into the flow of my reading because on occasion the metaphors simply don’t make sense. (Much like that run on sentence. Apologies).Speaking of run-ons, Mafi frequently uses similar devices to communicate Juliette’s mental state – her panic, her indecision, her confusion. While this is occasionally effective, it can also be jarring, and it took me some time to settle into Juliette’s fractured, erratic and struck-through manner of thinking.packs quite some steam, of the YA variety. There are almost more smouldering build-ups, electrifying contact (pun unintended – but rather apropos), gasping breaths and sexually charged scenes than you can shake a stick at. And while I liked the chemistry and interactions between Adam and Juliette, I can’t say I really bought their “history”. I’m not sure that the intention was achieved here, which seems to be setting up a backstory that essentially explains/excuses the apparent “instalove” development. This historical aspect of story simply didn’t feel real enough to me, or perhaps just a little too convenient.The direction of the plot is not hugely surprising. Unlike Juliette, at no point did my jaw ""fall on the floor"". Yet, I did find the action sufficiently compelling, and the characters interesting enough to remain invested in the story. One of my stars is awarded because I found wholly absorbing while I was reading it.This may sound strange, but the characterisation of Warner was a highlight for me. Here, I believe Mafi truly threw down (so to speak) and created a villain that was intriguingly complex; repulsive and yet oddly fascinating.Writing this review hasn’t done much to solidify my opinion on the book – if anything – I feel more conflicted than when I started. However, while I had my personal irritations with parts of the story and the lack of restraint in terms of the writing, I won’t deny that did exactly what I wanted it to, which was to be entertaining."
162,4,"Before I read this I had a feeling that the romance and love story was going to take over the whole book which is usually a big no no for me. I want action not kissing, I want fight scenes not lovey-dovey scenes, I want fighting against evil, not fighting against the desire to rip ones clothes off! The love story completely took this book over. Like after the original kind of dystopian tellings, I learned nothing really new about the world. I imagine that is coming in the next books but basically the love story hijacked the plot. But surprisingly I did like it... no wait I kind of loved it! But I can honestly say that the only and I mean ONLY reason why I loved it was because of Warner. Literally Adam can go away because all I care about is Warner.When I was first reading this I was just constantly rolling my eyes at Juliette and Adam. They were annoying. Juliette just kept describing herself as like a shattered mirror and Adam was the only thing keeping her together. Give me a break. Juliette you don't need no man! She just kept describing herself as powerless and hysterical and her only hope for being normal was Adam. I have so many problems with that. I can honestly say that at the start, this book was on a fast train to Two Starville. Then we got backstory and fine it wasn't exactly insta-love but yes it was like they never spoke or anything. Anyways. Warner comes into the picture and at first I'm like ""ooh typical baddie with all the clichéd lines"" but then... I fell in love with him. I don't even care that he's evil. He's mine. Usually I'm so anti-evil guy with hot bod and swoon-worthy looks but Warner was just so much more. Him and Juliette actually had a spark and something exciting, compared to that snoozefest romance between Juliette and Adam.I'm team Warner even though I don't really like Juliette that much, I mean she's okay!So I liked the story. That writing though. Talk about annoying. I didn't like the writing. Some of the descriptions literally made me go ""wtf"". I don't know if Mafi was trying to sound really original or something but it didn't work for me. Some of them didn't even make any fricking sense. She literally said someone smelled like courage and strength, anyone know what that smells like? I certainly don't. I wish I highlighted more but I was too busy going ""wtf"". And then we had those crossed out words. THEY ANNOYED THE CRAP OUT OF ME. I feel like if it was just in the journal I could have maybe handled it but Juliette crosses things off in her mind and it's annoying. It was constant and I needed it to stop. Mafi also wrote words multiple times in a sentence and it wasn't good it was just annoying annoying annoying. It gets old old old. But it is kind of fun to do do do. She needs to stop stop stop. Okay I'll stop now now now. Maybe she got carried away because I feel like it's addicting once you start doing it (*refrains from doing it 500 more times*). I think because the writing was like this, it made me dislike Juliette, well, not like her as much as I could have. All the characters were meh except for Warner and James. I loved James, he was a little sweetie (and I swear to God if anything happens to him, Miss Mafi, I will NOT be impressed!!!).So basically this would have been a two star rating if it wasn't for Warner and that cool kind of X-Men feeling at the ending. I can't wait to read what happens in the rest of these books. I would recommend this!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~“Everyone says I talk a lot.” He shrugged. “But what am I supposed to do when I have so much to say?” - (this is why I love James!)"
163,5,"4,5-5⭐️ - lange hat mich kein Buch mehr so einnehmen können wie „Shatter me“! Durchgängig hatte ich das Bedürfnis, weiterzulesen, war vollkommen im Sucht- und Hype-Modus gefangen - das haben zuletzt nur wenig Bücher bei mir geschafft. Die Grundsituation ist bereits spannend und originell, doch das eigentlich Besondere an diesem Buch ist der Schreibstil. Dieser ist wirr und dabei absolut genial: Worte werden wiederholt, durchgestrichen und damit zurückgenommen, es gibt kurze, dann wieder verschachtelte Sätze. Es entsteht das Gefühl, auf einer nahbaren, emotionalen Ebene in Juliettes Gedankenwelt entführt zu werden. Zudem hatte das Buch eine düstere Poetik. Jegliche Metaphern und Vergleiche konnten mich sehr berühren. Gefühlt wollte ich mir das halbe Buch anmarkern.Mini-Kritikpunkte (Insta-Love, Greifbarkeit mancher Charaktere, zu schnelle Entwicklungen…) lasse ich erst einmal außen vor, da ich überzeugt bin, dass diese im Verlauf der Reihe noch einen tieferen Sinn erhalten. LOVED IT!!!❤️❤️"
164,1,"Una estrella bien merecida.La primera palabra que me viene a la mente después de leerlo es: tóxico.La segunda: aburrido. La tercera: repetitivo. Cuarta: cansino. Quinta: pedante... Y podría seguir.No veo el romance por ningún sitio. Adam y Juliette apenas se conocen.Y bueno, lo de Warner no es amor, es una enfermedad mental o algo parecido.Al final empieza lo más ""interesante"", pero no lo suficiente como para querer seguir con la saga. Me importa nada, cero, lo que pase.No entiendo la fama y las buenas reseñas. No me apetece hacer una reseña más extensa porque este libro me enfada."
165,1,"There is a new book on the block. Shatter Me provides a fascinating, if disturbing, glimpse into the state and status of popular literature today, the registers in which that literature achieves meaning, and what we as readers really care about. I think that we should give Shatter Me serious, careful and methodical consideration. We should pay attention to what it says and the context in which it is said--and examine it and ourselves, and the industry, accordingly.The premise of is typical fare: a post-apocalyptic novel with a female protagonist. It is in fact so typical that it borders on insipid, if not astonishingly trite. However, what would normally constitute ""ah yes, here we go again"" material distinguishes itself clearly and immediately. From the very first page, metaphors abound, imagery surrounds, alliteration overwhelms. Maybe it absurdist art--like Samuel Beckett or Edward Albee? Or perhaps it is a self-parody--a Buffy the Vampire Slayer-style jab at the entire genre? Or maybe, just maybe, this is an excerpt from some manual of bad writing that the witty characters, soon to be revealed, will be reading and at which they will poke fun? Perhaps we are all but the fictitious imaginings of a single potted plant? But, alas, no. It is none of these. This, my friends, is real, earnest, serious writing. And, at that, it is just plain awful. It is melodramatic to the extreme. It is maudlin to pieces. It is both rare and overdone.What distinguishes from other over-used girl-in-post-apocalyptic-world-I'm-so-strong-but-so vulnerable-at-the-same-time books is it's lack of story. Beyond the premise, there is none; instead, Mafi thinks in terms of words, and tells her non-story in language so highly metaphorical one could say that it is simply ""high."" She strives for ecstatic prose, and, in doing so, leaves the rest of us in agony. comes off as beyond overwritten and speaks of an author who is highly egotistical, possibly to the point of insanity. And it couldn't have been more absurd if she wrote the same story from the perspective of mice-people. Smoking cigars. Speaking in limericks. The difference between a novel that barely tells a story (most of the current dystopian books hopping along The Hunger Games bandwagon) and a novel that over-tells a non-story () is really the difference between commercially-minded authors who know they can't write but think they can make it big as long as they cover the basic action/romance bases (most current dystopians), and an artistically-minded author who thinks only can write and will make it big by peddling other people's creativity as her own as long as she repackages it in bizarrely florid language (Mafi). It is the difference between plain, boring milk and spoiled chocolate milk with chunks of broccoli inside. And yes, it is both fascinating and disturbing to watch.So now the questions: why is this being published? If it sells, why does it sell? And even if doesn't, why do people think it will sell? Is the publishing industry so cynical that they think they can just regurgitate the same old spoiled milk and think that people will buy it? Do they think that we can't tell the difference between this and something good? Something new? Something, um, maybe, interesting? They should be ashamed. And so should we, for allowing them to think that they can get away with this."
166,4,"4 stars ✰oh my fucking god. when i tell you i wasn’t expecting it to be this good, oh boy was i wrong. im not even exaggerating, i was attached to this book from reading the first couple of chapters. but, i can see why some people hate it, especially the writing style, but i feel like we needed it to help us understand what juliette’s thinking. i loved this book, from the plot, the mcs, the writing style, the powers, the environment, the side characters and so on.adam, i don’t love him nor hate him but im just here for warner. (nvm i hate him now - edited) kenji is absolutely hilarious already, i can’t wait to read more of him and his and juliette's friendship growth.aaron warner, istg, ‘’ gets me EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. i can gladly and proudly say that im in love with this man already. him and his humour. the only blonde i will accept. he's literally so intrigued in juliette, i’m going insane. the way he speaks about her, ughhh."
167,4,"Un libro adatto un target di giovani. La protagonista ha un potere magico brutale e per questo è colma di sensi di colpa e si sente spesso incompresa. L'ambientazione è post apocalittica con due fazioni principali e la storia d'amore fa da cardine a questo primo volume. Non mi ha entusiasmato, ma rimane una lettura scorrevole e piacevole."
168,4,finally caved and started the series 🙃 all i can say is kenji’s an icon and adam just isn’t…also i’m waiting to see this aaron warner that has everyone in a chokehold cause so far this guy is either frantically obsessing over juliette or getting shot like there’s no in between 😃
169,3,"JAJAJAJAJAJAJA, acabo de terminar este libro y no puedo dejar de reír. Todo es tonto, inverosímil, conveniente y sobreactuado. Reúne todas las características que tanto se critican (ahora) en los libros juveniles:▪️ Una chica especial™, que es HERMOSA y CAUTIVANTE a pesar de haber pasado tres años enteros sin apenas bañarse y sin más alimento que un mísero desayuno cuando tenía suerte (porque todos sabemos lo sexy que es estar sucio y desnutrido). Que además tiene un poder ""incomprensible pero mortal"".▪️ Dos chicos enamorados de nuestra chica especial™. Uno bueno y uno malo. Uno con ojos verdes y otro con ojos azules. Uno con el cabello rubio y el otro castaño. Pero eso sí eh, los dos están BUENÍSIMOS. Y hay que recalcarlo porque el mundo se puede estar acabando pero al menos hay jóvenes que aún hacen abdominales y eso lo único que importa.▪️ Un mundo distopico subdesarrollado porque a nadie le importa que pasó en el planeta ni como funciona ahora el gobierno, sólo queremos leer escenas de besos y Tahereh lo sabe.Y así como eso hay muchísimas cosas más que conforman todo lo que está mal en la literatura juvenil. Pero, la verdad, and I'm not even sorry.Llamenlo guilty pleasure si quieren, pero que feliz me hace este libro 🤷🏻______________Me había mantenido alejada de este libro durante mucho tiempo por dos principales razones:Sin embargo, mi resolución acabó de pronto cuando un día hice el test de Epicreads y el resultado fue nada mas y nada menos que:Soy débil amigos, no pude resistirme al , así que comencé a leer la saga y ¿saben qué?La escritura me gustó. Puedo ver como es que puede molestarle a tantas personas, definitivamente no es para todo el mundo, pero a mí particularmente me parece distinta de una manera genial.Y la trama me pareció divertida y atrapante. Ahora, quiero hacer una aclaratoria y decir que Aquí el enfoque no está en explicaciones del estado actual del mundo -aunque si las hay-, ni del régimen del gobierno, el enfoque está en los sentimientos de Juliette. En su relación con Warner (eres cruel pero te amo bebé) y con Adam.El final me dejo queriendo más así que tuve que comenzar el segundo libro inmediatamente. Nunca antes me había alegrado tanto de haber perdido mi tiempo haciendo test sin sentido en internet."
170,3,"Rereading a book I first read when I was thirteen is something. The writing style in Shatter Me is kind of painful (more reminiscent of a teenage diary entry than a good dystopian), but the story itself is entertaining as hell. The page-turning drama with this love triangle never ends, and Juliette is already a surprisingly strong protagonist, holding her own in fights and maintaining her morals at all costs.It was really amusing to read my old review for this book and find out that I was a fan of Warner 😭I can’t believe I used to be charmed by such a caricature-y villain, especially since Warner's been nothing but a red flag the entirety of this book. Almost none of his true motivations were revealed yet, so the guy has no ground to stand on in terms of being creepily obsessed with Juliette. It seems nearly impossible for Tahereh Mafi to redeem his character based on the things he's done so far.... and yes, I’m saying this knowing damn well that she (somehow) does redeem him later on, lord knows how. For now I'm a comfortable Adam supporter in this love triangle, but I know things'll get turned on their head a thousand times before the series is through. Like I said: entertaining!Kenji and James are the best characters. I will not take criticism on this fact. Even my little thirteen year old self knew that the Kenji novella is where this series peaked (it being my only 5 star rating of all the books + novellas). It's good to know I grew some taste at point, because now he’s already my favourite from book one! I’m destined to love the corny best friend characters that hide their soft hearts by living to help others. KENJI SUPREMACY!!! Then we have James, who is Adam’s ten year old brother. He is the sweetest, most pure soul ever, so he automatically gets favourite status.The only reason I reread is because it was chosen for my school’s book club, so I don’t really think I’ll continue with the other books anytime soon. I’m always curious to revisit stories I liked when I was younger to see how my reading tastes have changed, and besides me favouring different characters this time around, I was almost equally as entertained as the first time I read this book four years ago. Who knows, maybe someday I’ll revisit the rest of the series!"
171,4,"I knew this book would be different. How did I know? Because this book has been recommended to me more times than I can count, and they all say the same: ""This one is different"".The earth as we know it is gone. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong colour. The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things. Their way including burning every book ever written to make people forget, categorising people based on what they can contribute to the Reestablishment and monitoring absolutely everything. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war.This book was kind of hard to rate, because it could easily have been a three star rating, but I felt the promise of something when reading the book.The writing is simple, making it an easy read with a fast paced storyline. The writing style, which is what I assume most people referred to when labelling the book different, really made the book more intriguing and was a great indication of Juliette's true character.This book just felt like foreshadowing for what's to come, and I can honestly say I have really high hopes for the rest of this series. This book is heavily based on Juliette, as would be expected, and I kept wanting to know more about the world. I can't wait to see where this author will bring the world-building, because her take on a dystopian society is one I found super interesting.Finally, can someone please explain why they love Warner so much? So many people consider him their favourite book-boyfriend, and all I see is red flags..."
172,2,"2.5 stars I don't have violent feelings towards this book, but nor do I love it.Review to come...maybe? Emily May's review expresses a lot of my thoughts about this one, plus the comments below and in the status updates."
173,5,"5/5⭐️Rereading shatter me made me realise that this book deserves 5 stars!! Not only 4, Idk what I was thinking when I first gave it only that small amount lmao.It was as good as I remember!!I loved diving back into my favourite series again. Shatter me was the first ever series I read when I got back obsessed with books, which therefore makes this rereading experience very nostalgic for some reason.. but in a good way!!I love falling back in love with the characters, the world, the romance, the friendships and everything else!! Reading about my favourite characters again has to be the most serotonin boost I’ve had all my life! It just makes me realise how much I adore this series and how much reading really means to me.This is literally the best series to start with when you want to get into reading.I mean, if you haven’t read the shatter me series yet, then wth are you doing?!?!?!It has everything a series needs to have!A fast paced and interesting plot, plot twists that’ll have you on the edge of your seat, an endearing romance story that’ll make you believe in love again (I’m not joking istg), funny and charismatic characters that you’ll be rooting for throughout the entire series and an amazing world/setting where everyone takes place.I’d say this book series is pretty fucking good and absolutely perfection but you better read it yourself so you can experience it yourself.Overall, I can’t wait to reread the rest of the series!! Definitely am looking the most forward to ignite me (iykyk)."

175,4,"Kind of addictive, honestly. I actually read it in under 24 hours.Yes, Juliette is whiny, but I didn’t mind her character. I already LOVE Kenji. Warner… is just kind of gross. I also don’t love Adam. Right now, shipping Juliette x her mental health."
176,5,"4.5 SterneDas Ende hat es für mich ein bisschen gekillt.Ansonsten war es ein wirklich, wirklich interessantes Buch, voller Emotionen und poetischen Beschreibungen. Nachdem ich mich ein wenig an den Schreibstil gewöhnt hatte, war ich voll drin.Ich freue mich auf die weiteren Bücher!"
177,4,"Shatter Me turned out to be a lot better than I thought it would be. After reading the reviews, I was hesitant about starting this series because of what everyone was saying about the writing and the format, etc. But it wasn't too bad actually.All the strikethrough text was tolerable. Much of it was contradictory to the regular text but that just goes to show what Juliette really thought/wanted as opposed to what she actually does or says out loud. It happens in a lot of books, if not all of them. But the difference is that the text in other stories are not crossed off like how it is in Shatter Me. So I didn't really mind the excessive use of the strikethrough effect.But a few things that did bother me are:1) Holy crap. I did NOT like the writing in this book. I don't know how to describe it exactly but everything was just so exaggerated. Almost every line or sentence was either a metaphor or a hyperbole. I wouldn't have minded if the author uses these devices here and there throughout the whole book but honestly, she overdid it to the point where it got annoying. Do I really need to explain how awkward this sounds? And the repetition. Oh, boy the repetition. much. See what I did there? Yeah, you get of these throughout the book as well.2) I get that these two have ""known"" each other since they were like 8 years old or so, but their relationship happened way too fast for me. And I say because although they knew each other, they never even spoke a word or actually interacted with each other until now. Everything between them was from afar. Then all of a sudden, They makeout a few times and are madly in love with each other. I love Adam as a character but as a love interest... I'm not really feeling it. Although they have their sweet moments, I'm still not 100% on this ship. It feels too convenient. Too safe. Too predictable.3) I'm still having a little trouble understanding The Reestablishment. I get that they're supposed to be this government sort of system that takes over, promising change and improvement. But did The Reestablishment come to be? are the people of The Reestablishment? I don't know if I missed the explanation or maybe I just wasn't paying attention, but I had a lot of questions regarding The Reestablishment that went unanswered. They just seemed to come out of nowhere offering to make the world a better place and doing the exact opposite. Hopefully the next book goes more into detail about this.4) One small thing that annoyed me was how everyone was literally in love with Juliette. Adam, Warner, even Kenji acted as if she's the most beautiful human being that's walked the earth or something. I get that these people probably haven't been laid in awhile or seen a beautiful woman, but really? We get it. Juliette is beautiful. We don't need to hear it from every guy that lays their eyes on Juliette.5) Is it just me or does anyone else think that for a society that has insufficient supplies and inadequate housing, everyone just seems perfect? Perfect face, perfect body. Beautiful. Handsome. Everybody in this book is physically flawless.But other than that, Shatter Me is surprisingly really good. It reminds me of put together haha. If you like either or both of those, then you would probably like this book."
178,3,"mam mieszane uczucia, bardzo chciałam się w niej zakochać jednak najzwyczajniej czegoś mi zbrakło ;(ma fajny vibe niezgodnej, jednak jednocześnie jest niesamowicie prosta, sama nie wiem jak to określić-mimo wszystko dobrze się bawiłam i znając życie za 5 minut sięgnę po 2 tom"
179,4,"Pat on my back for finally picking up this book. I admit, I already knew a lot about the characters before I even started the book but it didn't go how I expected.For starters, I didn't like loathed Aaron Warner but I keep getting promised that the rest of the books are gonna change that.I have to say that Aaron and Juliette kissing scene was ✨intense✨I can literally summarize the whole book in two sentences and world building was a little eh but that doesn't matter much because I enjoyed this so much, ate it up and I couldn't stop reading.And the ending though....pretty abrupt.Overall, the book felt a little hollow but the reading experience was AMAZING"

182,4,"✅ Powers✅ Dystopian world-building✅ Action✅ Pace and plot✅ Kiss of distraction🆗✅ Characters (some are ok, and some are great)🆗 Romance / kind of insta-loveJuliette has been held in an asylum for a long time, alone. She is trying her best to remain sane, but her routine changes the day Adam is brought as a cellmate. Once I got into this book, I could not stop, the fact that certain people have powers and are hunted because of it is nothing new, but I just loved how the author built this dystopian world. I like how Juliette yearns for small things and describes them in such a beautiful way.Once I started reading this book, I couldn't stop. The world-building, the pace, the action... It was all great! I also really liked the fact that Juliette could kill with just a single touch, and how she has been locked up and in complete isolation for one year because of that. It added complexity to her character.Juliette is not a bad character, I understand why she is so shy and meek since she’s been in isolation for so long and she fears her power, but I seriously hope that she will gain confidence and grow a spine in the next book, especially because we saw that she could be quite determined when she doesn’t want to do something. I mean, the girl can kill with a single touch, she should have more confidence just because of that. I am not criticizing her character, because I understand why she is so unsure, but I hope that she will have a little personality makeover in the next book. On the other hand, Adam is not a character that I care much about, he is shady, and the almost-instant-love is not my cup of tea.The characters that I really love in this book are Warner and Kenji. I do adore Warner as a villain, even if he seems a little psycho (I don't know what it says about me though...). He is complex, and there are many things that we do not know about him yet, which makes him even more interesting, and I can't help but love him SO MUCH MORE than boring Adam... Kenji is also a great character, he is funny and sweet, and I hope that he will get closer to Juliette in the next book and that we will also see more of him.There is a lot of action in this book as Juliette and Adam try to escape from Warner and find a rebel group. I do not want to reveal too much about this book, but it is a quick read, and I strongly recommend it (especially if you have a thing for awesome villains).Here is a fanart of Warner by Niru, just because I love him (even though he is portrayed as the bad guy)...Another Fanart by Avendell (I know it's a Dramione fanart, but I think it fits well with Warner and Juliette's descriptions too)Bookish song by Beth Crowley : ❤️🙂"

185,3,"I PRESENT TO YOUJULIETTE THE MATHEMATICIAN~I’ve been locked up for 264 days.I have nothing but a small notebook and a broken pen and the numbers in my head to keep me company. 1 window. 4 walls. 144 square feet of space. 26 letters in an alphabet I haven’t spoken in 264 days of isolation.6,336 hours since I’ve touched another human beingI only know.... who drove 6 hours and 37 minutes....But seriously, does she have a mental clock inside her head or what? And here I am, the girl who takes 1 hour to convert 12 hours into minutes.: This review doesn't follow my usual review format and focuses only on the writing. If you're looking for a review focusing on the other aspects of the book as well I suggest you check out  Anyways, moving on... while reading this book I had 2 moods~Now one might also state this paragraph in this literary style~""I could see a hazy reflection of the sun on the ocean, the vibrant colours splashing on the gently receding waves. The cool breeze was tenderly caressing the leaves, which were a blur of colours camouflaging with the evening sky.""But this is boring compared to the other paragraph (and I won't even begin with the grammatical errors I made) The way the former paragraph urges you to continue reading it, its captivating hold over you, is just missing in my description.So the writing might take some time to get used to, but once you get a grasp of it you realize how meaningful it really is. Its not just  'flowery' writing, if you take even a minute to analyse this paragraph, you gradually come to understand how exquisitely ornate it is. The descriptions are so very vivid and I was spellbound by how clearly I could imagine this scene in my head. But it's definitely not everyone's cup of tea and I can easily understand why people don't like the writing. There were quite a few times where I was annoyed by it or just failed to comprehend what the author was trying to say...As you can clearly see, I go on and on about how wonderful the writing is. But then I read the next page.And the next.And the next.And then my faith in humanityHonestly if I read this passage with zero context I'd think a 7 year old wrote it.And I don't know why I just found this one very irritating. You can just say you saw a human, why do you have such an UNNECESSARY flair for drama Juliette ?And then the repetition. Like S.T.O.P. already.Seriously I get it, you don't need to remind me I am too annoyed, too irritated, too sick of this.The strikings added a bit more depth to the writing but they were overused. A LOT. And by that I mean repeated in ~every other sentence~So overall, the writing was very picturesque but there were few exceptions *coughs* So if you are able to ignore these then good 4 u."
186,5,"When I first laid eyes on this cover I was like ""Holy ugar oney ce ea this cover is Beautiful!! "" Then I thought how could I get my Mom to buy me this book?...... Lol, I know its bad that I used Holy and a profanity in the same sentence and I was to cheap to buy the book myself but that was really what I thought about when I saw this book.I can truthfully say that I am glad that I (meaning my Mom) ended up buying this book for me because it was worth every penny!This book was amazing from start to finish! I finished this read in a few hours and I devoured and relished every moment of it! I really enjoyed Juliette's character and her OCD-ness. She was so drawn into herself but so aware of every little detail around her that you could almost see,touch, and feel what Juliette's every emotion and thought at that particular moment. I was so drawn in from the first page and through out the read that I read faster because the writing was like poetry and it flowed immensely. It was so beautifully written that I had to keep a notebook next to me to jot down a ton of quotes from the books because I loved them once I read them. I also liked how we can tell Juliette is different than the norm not only because we find out she's in a prison cell but by the way she processed and interpret things.I also loved the building romance between Adam and Juliette. it was weird and steamy and it brought a lot of sexual tension to the plot because no one could touch Juliette. As usual (which I love :D )their is a love/hate relationship between the two and then Adam is assigned as Juliette's watchmen and their relationship blossoms or should I say take's flight? The relationship between Juliette and Warner was fascinating to me! He was so twisted and charming that it was hard for me to hate him because he played bad so well. I think I like or understand Warner's love/lust for Juliette because I think he wouldn't know what love is if he's seen his father take and take everything he wants even id it had to do with land or women. Therefore I tend to sympathize with him because that's all he knows about life which is- to get what you want you have to take it without it being given freely to have it....but does that make me TEAM WARNER? Hell No! He's EEvill! This just means, me and him have an understanding of each other.I wanted More Kenji!!! He was one of my favorite character because of his charming personality. I also wished the first book included the second book with it! LOl I cannot wait till 2013!!!Beautifully written book and Tahereh Mafi has become my favorite author after I met her in April. I say this is a definite must read and it will be locked away in my favorites!P.S. I read this book in December 2011 and I am just now writing my review. I know sad."
187,5,"Tahereh Mafi has magically combined a lyrical and unique style of writing with the fluidity of fast-paced prose. Her use of strikethroughs for the heroine and narrator, Juliette’s, subconscious thoughts is pure genius. It allowed me to get to know her better and like her and admire the strength she doesn’t even know she possesses. As for Mafi’s turn of phrase… wowzer… her writing is stunning - poetry wrapped up in a dystopian superhero novel. There is nothing clichéd about Shatter Me. It’s a mash up of differing ideas that somehow piece together into something beautiful and new.Juliette’s character development over the course of the novel is powerful stuff. The prose changes slightly as it eases from the quick, short unbroken sentences of someone who has spent the past year living entirely in her own head to more fleshed out, ‘normal’ sentences as she begins to acclimate to being around people again.Love interest, Adam, is delicious - a little suspect at first, but strong, loving and loyal. The way his character unravels Juliette’s is utterly mesmerizing… the scenes with them together are written in pure word candy. Exquisitely yummy.Other minor characters are all excellent, every single one well-developed and three dimensional, but it is the strange, twisted, calm, irrational, cruel, gentle, deranged, affectionate and monstrous paradox that is Warner that I found most compelling of all. I love a book with a million shades of grey and Shatter Me is definitely a vast spectrum of the whitest grey to the darkest.The plot itself was incredibly fast-paced, suspenseful, disturbing, raw and action-packed. A dystopian science-fiction adventure that is just about to take off!Cannot wait for more of this world and its spellbinding writing.Five Massive Massive Stars!Favourite quotes from Shatter Me:“I always wonder about raindrops.I always wonder about how they’re always falling down, tripping over their own feet, breaking their legs and forgetting their parachutes as they tumble right out of the sky toward an uncertain end. It’s like someone is emptying their pockets over the earth and doesn’t seem to care where the contents fall, doesn’t seem to care that the raindrops burst when they hit the ground, that they shatter when they fall to the floor, that people curse the days the drops dare to tap on their doors.I am a raindrop.My parents emptied their pockets of me and left me to evaporate on a concrete slab.”“Juliette-“ His body presses closer and I realize I’m paying attention to nothing but the dandelions blowing wishes in my lungs.”“Killing time isn’t as difficult as it sounds.I can shoot a hundred numbers through the chest and watch them bleed decimal points in the palm of my hand. I can rip the numbers off a clock and watch the hour hand tick tick tick its final tock just before I fall asleep. I can suffocate seconds just by holding my breath. I’ve been murdering minutes for hours and no one seems to mind.”“His lips are spelling secrets and my ears are spilling ink, staining my skin with his stories.”"
188,5,"[ 5★ ]Such a good book, I can’t wait to continue the series!I’ll write a proper review in a sec"
189,2,"Warning: Mild Spoilers Ahead. Please read at your own risk.Actual rating: 2.5 starsThis is not a dystopian. This is a romance.This is a book I've avoided for a very long time. I never had the guts to pick it up, afraid it might not turn out well. I'm glad I finally did, though. Not because it was amazing, but because I finally get why there are so many mixed reviews out there. I had my expectations for this book. I thought I was going to read something entirely kickass with an amazing storyline. But unfortunately, that wasn't it. Like I said, this is a romance under the cover of dystopian.The writing, at first, bothered me to no end. I don't mean the strike-through thoughts. I mean this.I understand why Juliette's thoughts are so damn peculiar, I mean, she's not exactly a people person and hasn't talked to anyone in a really long time, but it bothered me. But after a few chapters, it started to grow on me. I found it less annoying and unbearable, I actually accepted it. The writing got better, but it still bothered me a few times, especially when Juliette and Adam are making out. Juliette described the feeling asFor some reason, I find that really disgusting. And she said something similar to that . Here's another. Adam's hurt, and he's asking Juliette if she wanted to be with him, and this is her reply.Ewwww. That is just . Who says that? This is not Fifty Shades of Grey, Juliette. I believe you are in the wrong book.The Plot. Nothing really happened in this book. The pacing was pretty slow. Basically, it started with Juliette in a prison. Adam comes into the picture. The typical Oh-he-looks-familiar-but-I-can't-place-it. Betrayal. Warner offers a proposition. Fall in love with Adam. Make out. Escape. Stays at Adam's house. Make out more. Kenji comes. Got discovered. Got caught. Escape again. The Last Civilization. The big reveal. And finally, .The main character, Juliette, is useless. Although she has the power to drain people just by a single touch, , she's always too scared to use it or afraid she might hurt someone. But, when you are threatened/kidnapped, wouldn't it be reasonable to reconsider your decision? She just refuses to do so, no matter what. When you are threatened, the first thing you should do is to hurt that person and run. I know it will make you feel bad, but you have no other option. Also, it seems like she doesn't care about anyone except her Adam and James. For example, Kenji. There was one scene when Juliette didn't know how to drive, and she just asks Kenji to do it. But Kenji was shot in his left leg beforehand, so he told her ""My right leg is still good."", and you know what she thinks in her head? ""I don't think I'd care if it weren't."" DUDE, THAT'S HARSH! Kenji got shot because of YOU, you escaped, and he had to be interrogated/tortured, and that's how you make it up to him. Ugh.There's another thing that bothered me. Her insecurity. She think she's a worthless because she's a social reject. Maybe I CAN relate to that, but you don't have to think about it all the time! She asked Adam why he wanted her so many times, I wanted to strangle her! Also, towards the end of the book, there was a scene when Adam was taken away for medical treatment. And you know how she reacted? She practically ! And she started questioning Kenji's intentions.The Doubting.Ugh, he's getting treated, and you can't follow, It's really not that much of a big deal, you know? Have some self-respect. Stop depending on someone else all the time.Adam, the love interest, is a typical nice guy. When he first showed up, he was a douche. But apparently, that was just an act. He was in love with Juliette since a long time ago. He was pretty swoon-worthy at first. But then, he started to bore me. He's not a bad character or anything. He's just...boring. (Sorry, this is the only word I can think of to describe Adam.) The romance between him and Juliette was boring as well. I don't get how two people can fall for each other in such a short time span. It's not instant love. No. But it's not those slowly progressing ones, either. They went to school together since fourth grade(?), but never even talked to each other. And the reason Juliette liked him was because he was the only person who would look at her like a normal human being. Well, personally, I don't think this is a good enough reason. But maybe I'm biased.Warner, Ohhh Warner! <3 He's a psychotic maniac who loves power. He's blonde, with emerald eyes. He's hot. He's dangerous. He's merciless. He's love to control people. And he is obsessed with Juliette, . To me, he's a really amazing character. I love him to bits. He basically has no moral standards. This is a guy who hates happy families. This is a guy who would do anything just to get what he want. And he's NINETEEN! *happy dance* The make out scene between him and Juliette is steamy and hot. I love how he showed his vulnerability and human side. This shows that he's not just a monster, he can be human if he wants to. I also love how he tells Juliette he loves her. Although that might just be him mistaking obsession for love, but WHATEVER! I LOVE YOU, WARNER! <3 It's okay if Juliette doesn't want you, you have my heart!Kenji, a friend of Adam's, is HILARIOUS! I find myself enjoying the book a lot more after he showed up, . I like his loyalty and honesty. He's kind of like Puck from The Iron Fey, excluding the love interest part. His jokes made Juliette's angst easier to bear. I really liked him as a character and hope he shows up more in *whispers*James, the little brother, is a meanie-head. Usually I like the siblings in a book, because they're usually adorable. But this is not the case. James, on the other hand, is a mean kid towards Juliette. I don't mean mean as , I mean I don't like his attitude toward her. (Wow, so many ""mean""s in this sentence!) He always asks Adam questions about Juliette , like she doesn't exist. And his questions are usually rude. It's like he's afraid Juliette will steal his brother away from him or something. I don't hate this kid, I just don't like him. What I don't get is why Juliette likes him. Yeah yeah yeah he's Adam's little brother. But if I'm treated that way, I wouldn't like the kid, not a bit. I'm not trying to sound harsh, but that's the truth. I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE TREATED AS IF I'M INVINCIBLE, and I don't get how Juliette can stand that.The ending. I like where this is going, the X-Men vibe is pretty interesting. And I also like how Tahereh Mafi ended the book. I definitely hope to see a much more kickass Juliette in the next book.Overall, although I did have some problems with the book, I really did enjoy it. Maybe not as much as I have hoped, but it's good enough. So, would I recommend this book? To be honest, I don't know. I'd suggest trying out the samples first, and see if you can handle the writing, Juliette...etc. I *think* I will be reading both and sometime later. Until I don't hate Juliette so much, that is.Phew. This is probably the longest review I've ever typed. Sorry if there are any grammar mistakes in here."
190,4,"“The moon is a loyal companion.It never leaves. It’s always there, watching, steadfast, knowing us in our light and dark moments, changing forever just as we do. Every day it’s a different version of itself. Sometimes weak and wan, sometimes strong and full of light. The moon understands what it means to be human.Uncertain. Alone. Cratered by imperfections.”Sooooo that was Shatter Me huh?🤭I have to say this was more romance than dystopian, which I didn't expect😮 ... considering this was written in the peak time of dystopian novels, I was kinda surprised but I liked it. I only really felt it towards the last 100-ish pages and all .was an intricate character. We first meet her in an asylum and see her tiptoeing around madness. We quickly became familiar with her past and how she was always neglected, feared and bullied. She undoubtedly has a good heart and despite her past and everything is still kind and wants to have a normal life😥🖤 .,okay I kinda imagine this is going to be an ACOMAF kind of twist I mean come on he won me over with his childhood trauma .Also I said I liked him but not with JulietteFirst of all I think he really played Juliette who was desperate for human touch, love and companionship.Second of all the whole - I remeber you and I loved you since then and all of a sudden I kiss you and I can touch you - yeah no, too shadyy he knows stuff 👀Are we though ?In love with a criminal ?I'm conflicted 😂Yeah like the quotes he gave us slayyy 💅he came for the last 100 pages and stole the show ,I loveddd him 🖤What I didn't like is the description in this ,why do we have sooo many eye descriptions like 👀I though that was a bit excessive otherwise everything was good4✨-------------------previous updates--------------🏃‍♀️This better serve - slap- rock my world causeYeah this better work🙃"
191,2,"I got sucked into Shatter Me, despite its faults, because I was intrigued by the premise and wanted to know more. But despite an interesting setup and some pretty steamy scenes, the book ultimately fell flat.The writing in Shatter Me moves back and forth between lyrical and distracting. Many of the metaphors make no sense and pull you out of the story. Also, anything more than 1 metaphor per page is too many in my opinion, and this book is just drowning in them.There is very little world building in Shatter Me, and the bad guys never seemed all that real. We never get a clear idea of what they wanted with Juliette, or what they were doing with the world. They're just a generic evil dystopian ruled by a crazy guy.Juliette is an inconsistent character: on one page she's on the floor sobbing, then she's standing up to a guy with a gun, then the next page she's back on the floor acting pathetic. I also hated how every single male character in this book wants her, no matter how much of a mess she is or how dangerous they think she is. Not to mention she is the ONLY female character in the book. Ugh.The worst part, by far, is the last 50 pages. They go in an entirely new direction without any warning or foreshadowing, and turn the book into a poorly disguised X-Men imitation. There's no real climax and absolutely no resolution to the plot. Instead, the last 50 pages introduce a bunch of new characters and add a ton of clunky exposition. I think this would have worked better as the beginning of book 2.Overall, the book is romantic and exciting at times, but in the end not very original or satisfying. As a friend of mine said, the book feels like one very long prologue."
192,3,"3.5 stars !! This book was soo good. I didn’t expect that I would enjoy it.. but I did. When I read the first few pages, it already had me hooked. It was easy to read and literally a page-turner since I couldn’t even put it down. At first, I like Adam a lot but throughout the book, he became a bit boring lmao. But Warner and Kenji?! um, yes !! I want more of them."
193,4,"Finished my third reread 20/ 12/ 2022 and I honestly have no idea how I got through this dumpster mess with potential a few years back 🥲......#2 Twelve days of reviews (I feel so productive-)Basically me gushing about how perfect Warner is and bashing everything else.As it should be *le french wink**french makes is fancier*Starting with the basics, the three criteria for reading this book should be:*You are able to withstand the torture of an annoying and whiny protagonist.*You are able to induce calm into your system as said MC decides to be metaphorical every. single. chapter.**You are able to understand that obsession is only nice in YA dystopian books.*wheeze*I know loving Warner can be controversial, I really do. But some people adore that dude from You.I consider my decision less... painful.Moving on, before I question my missing moral compass more than I do, this book was published when the YA dystopian era was at its finest. Not-like-other-girls-MCs reigned supreme and frankly, I believe that those years were bloody awesome.: The Hunger Games (Katniss still owns me): Divergent (I know I know, I didn't think I would love it but okay): The Selection (again, same problem)Oh, those wonderful early 2010s... *claps hands* jumping over the nostalgic pang of I-must-re-read-every-book-from-those-years, let's recognize for a minute that if Warner wasn't Warner, there would be a problem.More on that topic in the following segments.The for this book was so unique and utterly magnificent to my past self that she could not resist falling for it. Girl gets locked up in a mental institution because she killed someone. Girl can kill with touch. Love triangle. Bad boy. All of them with daddy issues but okay.I still think all of that is super cool.Minus the daddy issues.Which everyone in this book seemed to have.I adored the details that bled on the page (perhaps too many, though that's for the 'writing' part to tackle), how it transformed my cozy bed into a prison cell with dank nightmares stalking ever corner. The ambience and feel of the whole book was sort of like looking through a foggy glass, everything just this far out of reach. I remember reading chapter after chapter, day turning into evening turning into the early signs of a new morning and still, I would stay entranced and perplexed with everything that was assaulting my senses everywhere I looked.I know there were some inconsistencies, yet I couldn't bring myself to care. (mind you, this was maybe the third dystopian book I'd ever read)The dark depressing notes written by Juliette, mingled with the lightness the rest of the characters brought in, I knew that I couldn't get attached to the storyline as it progressed, but I couldn't stop myself. There were some twists, escape plans (which weren't even plans), forbidden kisses that dredged up feelings in the characters they didn't want to have, friendships were lightly trekked, and new characters flawlessly placed within the pages.The whole Adam and Juliette hellhole, did not exist to me.I forbid myself to even consider them a thing.Okay yeah, fine, I admit it, the plot was pretty good. Not great, but an enjoyable experience to have.At least back then.Now the .AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA *chokes on spoon*Well, see, hyperboles and metaphors are amazing. I fall in love with them when done exquisitely well, but come on.I'm sorry, the heck is this-*wheeze*Someone give me a defibrillator, please.I won't even feign to understand that one. And at those moments, I did not give a flying pig's tail what was written as long as it got the message across. But it got kind of tedious when I had to figure out (mid-paragraph) if what was happening was real or made up (so so fun). Reading some quotes now, not everything was bad, of course. There were some masterpieces such as:*Booksy has been coffinated*Excuse me????? I am already dead???? Why do you keep doing this????But then we would go back to this:And this:*frantically dialing* 911-this ain't right.It was basically and truthfully a game of ping pong, you just won't know if you'll get a spiked ball or one made of cotton candy. Overall though? I got lost in it. After reading, I got the audiobook and somehow, with someone else reading it, the writing took a little more shape. Lost a little pretentiousness.Just please, if she giggles. Just say that. Don't say, and her voice cut off in weird intervals that simulated a sliver of laughter peeking through the blinds on New Year's Eve, hopeful to be recognized and lost without ambition.Because I will throw a piano at your head.And that's not a metaphor.The redeemed it, of course.Character, in singular. (I consider Kenji and Warner, one)Starting with the (do I really have to??? Yes, yes you do Booksy) Juliette Ferrars. Locked up, thrown away, emotionally shattered Juliette. For a time I admired her vicious way of being able to survive. And then that admiration slowly... ever so agonizingly slowly (not really, it was like a bullet)... she started making stupid decisions. And no, this is not Booksy ranting without reason, pfft.So, she got out of the mental institute to work for a guy (I did not read the footnotes), said guy is handsome, cruel and seemingly heartless. SAID GUY offers her food and clothing, so she can get stronger, what does J do? Oh, the right decision, obviously.Oh, I'm sorry. Is this not the greatest idea ever invented by a seventeen year old?Silly me.*sigh**extreme massage of forehead*Sweetie, yes, I will be patronizing right now. You want to escape, do you not? You crave it with every raindrop (metaphor, metaphor, metaphor) in your being, yet you don't eat. And then proceed to faint. And then proceed to fall instantly in love with a soldier.I want to cry, y'all.Out of utter hatred.You know who else cause me to claw my hair out? .I'm trying to breathe deeply here.What purpose did he have? Nada.Did he do anything that didn't annoy me? NadaWould I run him over with a truck and leave him for dead? N- absolutely.At the beginning, I was with him (though I loathe to admit it), I cared for him, nurtured my love as it grew. And then he would proceed to be this uber nice person out of nowhere and the SUSPICION it would hit me with.And then the between them- oh dear goodness gracious the third, even when I was new to YA, I grimaced. Cringed away. Shuddered in terror.Because how could he fight when (blond haired gun wielding, freaking perfect) was in the picture?Warner, a broken young man with a horrible past, part of a corrupt government and craving yet denying the fact that he wanted some sort of connection with a real person.*le tears**I can be that real person**I am literally real*I am aware that I despised him at times, I really really did. I wanted to carve his eyes out when he would make these... decisions that would make Juliette despise him more and me love him more and gah, too complicated. I wanted to hug his pain away, to be honest.*Warner it still isn't too late-*And all Juliette did was shoot the guy.Exactly.The were what kept me going when the writing got difficult to handle.= too adorable to comprehend. Wanted to squeeze his cheeks half of the time.= I'm not even- he was beautiful, inside and out. And I know he would make a comment about his inner organs so yes, Kenji, even your pancreas looks nice.EVERYONEELSETHATI'MFORGETTINGWEREAWESOMESome, I hated. Some, I despised. Some, I adored too much to function, knowing that they would have to perish somehow.And some, well, I ended up forgetting. Ayyyyy, Warner deserved better. Let's just begin with that. Juliette got on my nerves, yet I understood her overall purpose (making me hate her-). Kenji is my other soulmate (if you hurt him, I will dismember you). I do believe that people who have read a lot more dystopian would think this unoriginal and tedious to get through, but to those who haven't read too much of this genre or are looking to bash in some fictional heads, go ahead! (hehe)Just saying though, I called dibs on Warner a loooong time ago.And that goes for J-Whine as well.P.S: Get Adam out, if you will...........................I'm sorry. I truly am.But I loved this."
194,2,"My Review/Rant:👻Umm so Juliette is a shrimp that cannot do a thing for her life until the end of the book. Like I'm supposed to care about this girl who only cares about making out with a man when her life is in danger.I hate Gr says this book is: ""Dystopia, Ya, Fantasy, than Romance"" Let me tell you this whole book is a romance. Juliette is terrible at describing anything other than her delicious Adam and how much she hates Warner.Warner is ugh idk: A TERIBIBLE PERSON? I see so many girls loving this man on booktok and let me tell you. He kills a man in this Book. Idc if he ends up having a sob story backstory about his mother dying or some crap. That's unredeemable. Unless he is being mind controled or smth like that I will never like Warner in the upcoming books. He is not cute by being a bad boy. He is a bad person and ofc Juliette is so defenseless. She is a freaking twig until the end of this book. She DROPS her gun when her life is on the line and even than is still thinking about making out with Adam. Even in the worst moments all she thinks about is a man touching her. Like grow up Juliette. There is people on the line and you cane help with your ability, but all she does is feel sorry for herself. Don't get me started on Adam. Half the time I didn't trust him because the book doesn't want you to until later they never bring that up again? Like why bring that into the plot if it doesn't matter??!!The world building sucked. All we know is the weather is horrible and everything is terrible. That's it. Juliette like i said is terrible at describing things unless it's about delicious Adam. ALSO CAN WE TALK ABOUT HOW EVERY CHARACTER IS SUPPOSED TO BE BEAUTIFUL?? Apparently Juliette, Adam, Kenji, and Warner are all model looking people in a dystopian world lol.My Likes:I gave this book 2 stars lol. But imo it deserved it. For 2 reasons: Kenji and the ending. Kenji is the only real characterI really enjoyed. He is genuinely really funny and actually acts/talks like a real person. p̶l̶u̶s̶ ̶h̶e̶'̶s̶ ̶c̶u̶t̶e̶The ending actually had some world buidling elements and didn't have Adam and Juliette making out at all, go figure.I have a guide for this book!! :D-Idc, I usually wait till the ending to put my music playlist but it was the only thing keeping me sane from the making out so here it is: (Btw it's lofi)-There is TONS of swearing lol. Like TONS. Also some references to Explicit stuff but nothing too crazy. If you want to be sure i reccomend looking it up before reading.-This book is 329 pages. The paper back is not too big and it only took me 3 days to read.-Pinterest/Visual Guide:-Just don't read this if you come for the plot or the dark aspects of a dystopia world. You will be majorly disappointed buddy and I would hate for you to endure it. It's mostly romance.-There is many intention grammar mistakes. mispronunciation, and marked up words. It can be confusing.-Told in 1st person point of view!Tysm as always for reading my reviews. They really make me happy when I see people like them and read the whole thing. Even if it is a rant review it still takes me a lot of time to think about and write. If you made it this far pls lmk what you thought. Thx. <33"
195,4,"“Raindrops are my only reminder that clouds have a heartbeat. That I have one, too.”I have some thoughts.So, first of all, I'm gonna talk about the writing. I did like the aspect of the metaphors and strikeouts, it showed how Juliette was going kind of crazy, though she denied it. The writing throughout the series will show her growth as a person.The plot was also intriguing, and twisting and turning, and it actually kept me captivated throughout the story.Now, the characters. So, I kinda went into this series already in love with Warner, because that's just how I am, falling in love with the villain. And with that love for Warner, came a hatred for Adam.So, I won't mind if Adam dies.Though when reading about Warner, he's kind of an obsessed psychopath as of now....but oh well. Maybe he'll get better. Something's wrong with me heheh.....And I freaking LOVE Kenji! He's hilarious, and I love his personality. Juliette is an interesting narrator because she's obviously kinda crazy and nuts from lack of human interaction.Anyways, I enjoyed the book and I have the next book sitting next to me, so I'm gonna go and read it!4 stars"
196,4,"4.5/5 starsI adored this book! At first I found it a bit slow and confusing, but as I read on, it got better and better.Juliette is a great protagonist and narrator. Tahereh Mafi's writing style is beautiful and I really enjoyed the striked text. It enables the reader to really get inside Juliette's head and gives more insight into Juliette's true thoughts and feelings.Adam. I wasn't sure how I felt about him at first, but I ended up really liking him. His relationship with Juliette is so sweet and passionate.Warner is an awesome antagonist. He is a very interesting and complex character who I want to learn more about.Overall, this is an amazing first book in a trilogy and I have high hopes for . I loved the setup for the sequel at the end and I'm excited to find out what will happen next!"
197,2,"I have been locked up for 15 days. 50 chapters. 1 epilogue. 338 pages.it has been the worst horror of my life.today, I was freed. freed from the misery, the torturous words that haunt me as they floated off the page and were imbedded into my mind. they showed no mercy. none. I am merely a lone soldier trying to catch the rose pedals as they fall from the sky, trying to free myself of this horror novel.I can not go on, it is so, so hard. harder than the coal I’ve always received on christmas morning.my brain cells, there are none left. they have been plucked from my head and left to die die die, to fall to their miserable deaths, to decay in hell for all of eternity.poor, poor, me.poor, poor, brain cells."
198,3,"3.25⭐️ I’m still not sure what to think about this book because 45% of the time it was really fast paced and interesting but the other 55% of the time it was quite boring and seemed to drag. I’m also not to sure what to think about any of the characters too (I’m currently in 2 minds about Warner, Adam and Kenji, I have not a clue who to trust).Tbf this is the first book and people have said that it gets better over time so I’m going to continue with the series and we shall see!"
199,0,"So, after reading some amazing reviews I know for a fact I will hate this book.Did I still add it to my tbr? Y E S"
200,2,"2.5 STARSI laughed so much while reading this book at how bad it is. I don't even know what to rate it because while it's not a good book, I couldn't stop reading, and I kind of enjoyed it?Tiktok made this sound like it would be really good, and maybe it will in later books, but I was not expecting it to be like this.It doesn't deserve a high rating, but it feels wrong to give it 2 stars because, on my rating scale, that means I didn't really like it, which isn't the case here. But it also feels wrong to give it 3 stars or higher because I know so many better books that I gave 3 stars. Maybe when I read the next book in the series, I'll bump up this rating.I read it so quickly, mainly because it was so short but also because I genuinely wanted to keep reading. Despite all its flaws, I somehow didn't hate it.I'm trying to consider that it was written in 2011 when the expectation for books was lower and books were full of tropes. However, that just doesn't excuse how bad the writing was. I've read books published around that time and the writing was significantly better. There even was an author's note at the beginning stating that the way it's written is intentional (the strikeout, use of numbers and other things), which would improve when Juliette grows as a character. With that in mind, it makes sense why some of the writing was like that, but it was still just plain bad. This is, however, the first book, so it could improve in the later books. Also, I get this is YA, but why did that even need an author's note. Aren't your readers supposed to pick that up on their own??This was my first dystopian in a LONG TIME, if this can even be called that. The world-building was so poor, and honestly, the main focus was the romance. I'm probably going to say this a lot in my review, but this could improve in the later books. I've heard people say this feels more like a prequel or that things don't happen till later books, so I'm hoping we get a better explanation of the world.The characters in this were okay. I didn't find Juliette as annoying as much as others did. HOWEVER, I forgot how much I hated when the protagonist has absolutely no flaws and is perfect until I read about Juliette. Her only issue was her power, if that can even be called an issue. It was constantly emphasised how good of a person she was to everyone, how she always put everyone first and cared about everyone more than herself. Which people can be like that BUT NOT TO THAT EXTENT. ALSO, NOT TO MENTION THAT SHE'S APPARENTLY SO PRETTY, AND EVERYONE IS INSTANTLY ATTRACTED TO HER AND WANTS HER. It makes a book so boring when the main character is like that.Now was the romance probably one of the worst I've ever read? Absolutely. BUT did I slightly enjoy it? Yes. Do I think I will enjoy it more when it turns into a love triangle with Warner? Yes again.I'm part of the small percentage of people that don't mind love triangles and sometimes even enjoy them. Although, there wasn't one yet in this book. However, I agree with everyone else's hate for insta love because I DESPISE IT. It's one of the worst tropes, and Juliette and Adam's relationship was one of the worst examples. It was so quick, and they barely knew each other. IT MADE NO SENSE WHATSOEVER. It was probably just because.I still do not yet understand why everyone loves Warner. BUT I see the potential for it. I have the Destroy Me novella, and I read the description, so I sense that I soon will as well.Overall, objectively this was one of the worst books I've read in a while. BUT just because it's terrible doesn't mean I can't enjoy it. Despite all its issues, I will continue with the series and will probably even finish it.---ive heard this isn't that good but somehow tiktok managed to push to the top of my tbr. ive been spoiled a lot so hopefully that doesn't affect my enjoyment. also this is my first dystopian book in a REALLY long time so im nervous.---for some reason i had a dream about this book and it was possibly one of the weirdest dreams ive had. was it a sign to finally read this HAHAHA"
201,3,"✨3 stars✨I’ve heard absolute raving reviews of this book, I’ve been recommended it a million times, and yet here I am, not really understanding the love. Yes, the writing style is beautiful and conveys Juliette’s anxiety and fear amazingly realistically and accurately, but aside from that I just didn’t think the story was anything that special. I‘m confused, basically. I was expecting such incredible things and it just kind of felt a bit bland if I’m honest.Aside from Juliette, none of the other characters are really all that defined, and the only reason Juliette is even remotely distinguishable is due to her narrative. The repetition and crossing out of thoughts is so prominent, the occasional garbled lack of punctuation really conveys her jumbled and panic ridden thoughts, and it’s genius. I’m so in awe of the structure of this book, Juliette’s obsession with numbers and specifics getting less and less as the book goes on and she becomes more comfortable and accepting of herself and those around her. It’s such well thought out writing and I’m genuinely really impressed by it, it delivers such a clear message of Juliette’s headspace without having to lay things out too extensively. Her character development is so intrinsic to the writing, both reflecting one another, and yeah I’m in love with it (I’ll stop now but it’s so brilliantly written). The whole concept of Juliette’s power is ridiculously enthralling, I found myself getting so lost in wanting to find out more about it- why she has it; how it works; why it doesn’t work on certain people- and I’m eager to find out more about that in the rest of the series.Adam, Warner and Kenji are essentially all the same character, don’t try and fight me on this. Adam is the ‘loving’ cardboard cut out, Warner is the ‘obsessive and dangerous’ cardboard cut out, and Kenji is the ‘slightly mysterious but overly friendly’ cardboard cut out. If you know of any other characteristics they possess in this book then please let me know because sure as hell can’t find them. I don’t trust any of them in the way I should (except maybe Kenji, but that’s just because he’s the only one so far to not randomly profess his love to Juliette). Adam hadn’t previously talked to her but was in love with her for years, and Warner wants to use her power and somehow has twisted this desire into what he thinks is love for her. It’s all very insta-lovey, regardless of who you’re rooting for (I’m not rooting for either of them, although Warner is the more intriguing of the two), and I just didn’t really care as much as I wanted to.Plot wise, I’m not really sure what went on. Things only started picking up and truly getting interesting once they got to Omega Point, and even then nothing really happened. It felt like a lot of setting up, if I’m honest, and considering there was such little world building it definitely could have been done in way fewer words. I have no clear image of who the characters are and what their motivations are aside from Juliette, and the plot went from being with Warner to being with other people with powers. That’s the extent of the setting up that took place. I’m all for books that take the time to lay out the story properly, but this just felt like a whole lot of not much. However, I am going to continue on with the series in the hopes that it gets better (I’ve been told that it does so let it be true!!). I’m excited to get to know more about Omega Point and its inhabitants, and I’m desperately hoping that any and all love interests stay away, because they really didn’t add much to this book (it’s not very likely but , a girl can dream). All in all, I didn’t love it but I also didn’t hate it, so I can’t really complain too loudly."

203,3,no puedo creer que el año pasado le di 4.5 estrellas a este libro…todo pasa demasiado rápido y es muy introductorio pero bueno es entretenido amo la distopía no lo voy a negar
204,4,"I was very excited to have gotten a hold of this ARC. I saw this book a while back and the cover first attracted me to read the blurb, which sounded fascinating. After reading it, I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. It was quite the joyride: an exciting, fast paced dystopia. I've been a fan of dystopian novels since The Hunger Games and I'm always happy to find new gems in this exciting genre. I love the exhilaration, the emotional struggle and high speed survival that books like these are filled with.Juliette has never been able to touch someone without inflicting pain, or worse. When her parents didn't know what to do with her, they send her away to an institution. It's a dystopian world, not so far in the future, where what's called The Reestablishment is trying to take over, and they want Juliette's power for themselves.At first I wasn't really fond of all the striked out thoughts Juliette was having. They were distracting and I felt like I wanted to skip over them, but worry not, they dissipate towards the middle when she starts getting more rational. I do admit that it does help make her seem frenzied. Which is to be expected from someone witch her ability. Being locked up definitely did not help her sanity either. So, though it's an annoying format, it served it's purpose.The writing was respectable. I saw a few minor plot holes here and there, but for a debut author - a 23 year old nonetheless - I was impressed. I found Juliette's situation to be very well portrayed. You could see that the stress of her situation affected her mentally as well as physically. It was realistic and true. The romance was a bit fast though; your typical YA love at first sight deal. But I looked to my inner teenage lust full heart and I okayed it. :)I enjoyed the fast pace of this book. Weeks go by in a flash of a few pages. This doesn't always work in novels, but it sets the mood in this one. It does seem to go by faster than expected a time or two, but the story isn't affected by it and we get to move along with the plot instead of dwindling on idle facts. Towards the end, the story takes on a more casual pace and the world building get more elaborate. We delve deeper in the superpowers and conspiracies of their new age. The second novel should be pretty amazing!I am currently hosting a giveaway on my blog - - for this ARC, ending September 27th. It's worth the read!"
205,1,"Al fiiin lo terminé, fue horribleSe me hizo eterno y solo me puse las pilas porque ya no quería leerlo más xdLa historia absurda, por momentos incoherente, y a pesar de ser una distopia en lo único en que se centro la autora fue en el romance de la prota y las tonteras que hacía Warner.Perdón por el spoiler, para los que lo vieron xd se me fue 🙏Muy predecible y conveniente, que coincidencia que a la chica que no pueden tocar porque si lo hacen mueren hayan dos personas, intereses amorosos, que son inmunes a ella 🤦‍♀️La chica era tonta, insegura, la trataron pésimo toda su vida y era débil, sin carácter, un cero a la izquierda. Warner un enfermo y Adam, no tengo idea, ni siquiera tengo una opinión de él un personaje básico.Al menos me va a servir para dos retos 🐭"
206,4,"This book was amazing! It was intriguing the whole way through and I absolutely loved the writing style. I cannot wait to continue on with the series and see what happens next. My only is wish is that there was a little more world building, but I'm sure this will continue to be explained in the next books. Also, the dialogue was WAYYY too cheesy for my taste. Overall, a great read!"
207,4,"każdy kolejny reread uświadamia mnie, że cały czas jestem zakochana w tej serii, a jedynym jej minusem jest Adam."

209,2,"*blows out strangled breath* Yikes.My friends, this is a perfect example of why you shouldn't always listen to hype. Sometimes people are gushing about a book for good reason, and other times you have to wonder how things end up on BookTok. Unfortunately, my feelings for this book fell in the latter category.This story is told through the eyes of a seventeen-year-old girl named Juliette who has a unique ability: she can kill people with a touch. Because of this, she's been imprisoned in an asylum for nearly a year, never told where she is and never allowed to see another human being. Until one day, she's assigned a ""cellmate"" and her world turns upside down.starts out with such amazing potential. Tahereh Mafi's writing style is quirky but not in an irritating way- at least, not at first. I really enjoyed the first eighty pages or so as we wonder whether or not Juliette is really insane. The erratic sentences, the trite use of numbers, and the bevy of metaphors- all that I thought was unique and added a sense of urgency to Juliette's character. However, as events progress and Juliette regains a firmer control over her thoughts, these things fall away and the writing becomes fairly unattractive.Juliette develops from an interesting and likeable main character to a banal YA female protagonist. I started off rooting for her, but by the end of the book I was rolling my eyes so hard I probably pulled a nerve. It should be an indicator that she's the kind that ""doesn't realize they're beautiful"" and so has to be reminded by every male character in existence. Though considering Juliette is the female character for 99% of this book, the men don't have much to choose from.Speaking of the men...I'm lost. Whenever I heard about this book, it was always or I don't think I've heard of anyone liking Adam, and that, at least, is something I can agree with. But I grew no attachment to the men in this book whatsoever. Simply put, they were all Adam. This book was and and Adam played a central role in that. Adam is Juliette's cellmate, and Juliette has no idea who he is. Later on, she admits that she recognized him all along because they were in fourth grade together or something and she apparently has an excellent memory. Adam, of course, admits that he knew her all along too and had a crush on her since they were 8- even though they never spoke to each other. And after a hundred or something pages, these two are smooching all over each other.Excuse me while I go throw up. *barfing sounds heard in the distance*reads like one of those where the author gets too carried away with the male love interest for there to be any plot. Aside from a few sporadic events, unless you count the kissing scenes and declarations of forever love when the main characters have known each other for five minutes. The dialogue in this book was that I had to put down the book several times and stare at the ceiling for ten seconds before resuming. And every other sentence is cut off by a character interrupting another, which, as you can imagine, gets old very quickly. This book honestly feels like one of those fever dreams you have in middle school where you start writing the first few chapters of a novel and you give up, only Mafi kept going and it kept getting worse.I think one of my biggest issues with this book is the A basic foundation for the world is set down at the beginning of the novel, but aside from some simple characteristics, the world isn't developed at all. There's no explanation for why things are the way they are. The settings were difficult to perceive. I feel like I could stick a pin in this worldbuilding and it would all come crashing down.My only compliment to this book is its length. I liked that it was a short and easy read, but that was about the only aspect that retained a star in my rating. Even so I felt that the few events that actually occur happened too quickly.Overall, has an excellent concept that is executed poorly. I'm still unsure whether I'm planning on reading the rest of the series, but I suppose I'll wait and see. Either way, it's not worth the hype."
210,4,"CriticallyPlot - 4 out of 5 starsDefinitely not what I was expecting. It was a bit confusing at times because of the worldbuilding, I still don't really know how this society is really like. It was also slow in the beginning but it picked up and charged ahead with adventure and mystery. Unfortunately, it did leave me a bit disappointed.Writing Style - 5 out of 5 starsABSOLUTELY LOVE HER WRITING STYLE! It's so poetic and full of emotion. In the beginning it's a bit repetitive but it only adds to the feelings that are being portrayed by the main character, but it slowly looses that aspect.Characters - 4 out of 5 starsOverall, the characters are all well developed, complex individuals. In the beginning, I didn't trust Juliet. She seemed completely crazy and unstable. But once I got deeper into the story, she grows in confidence and becomes braver and more determined which I really appreciated. I don't know how this changes but right now I feel like Warner is completely psychotic, unpredictable, dangerous, evil and completely obsessed with Juliet for all the wrong reason. On the other hand, Adam is very protective. He risks a lot to help Juliet and get her away from Warner the cuckoo. He's loving and open and smart and I'm scared about the changes!!"
211,4,"Audio re-read August 2019Opinions remain the same------------------------------------------------4 stars!Juliette cannot touch anyone, literally. Any touch to her body can kill a person if in contact long enough, and her parents went to extreme measures to make sure no one would. Locked up in an insane asylum for 264 days, Juliette has had no contact with another human being. That is, until she is given a new roommate, Adam. Juliette remembers Adam who she last saw three years ago, but he doesn't remember her. Why is he in her cell now? Has The Reestablishment changed their minds on what to do with Juliette?I read a review from another reviewer who said everything about Shatter Me is perfect except the cover; and I wholeheartedly agree. The cover for this fantastic read has absolutely nothing to do with the book and I'm really glad I read the book despite the misleading/ugly cover. Juliette's point of view was written incredibly well, the crossed out lines conveyed to the reader how unstable Juliette felt in her own mind at most times.The mystery of Juliette's world was cleverly done due to the author's writing style, the reader only knowing what Juliette knows and therefore we can only see how bizarre things have become through her eyes. The chemistry and love story between Adam and Juliette is what kept this book going for me, there's is a sweet tale that needed to be heard, and I can foresee it only becoming even better in future books.Warner is by far one of the most interesting villains I've ever read in a dystopian novel, I cannot wait to read the second book and see if Mafi peeled back the layers on his character for the reader. Shatter Me is a highly enjoyable novel that reminded me a little of X-Men meets Divergent and I highly recommend it.Follow me on ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥ ♥"

Başta biraz zorlasa da çabuk alışılıyor. Juliette' i çok sevdim. Ama Adam'ı sevip sevmediğime emin değilim. Hikayeyi ve akıcılığını, sürekli ne olacak diye merakta bırakmasını sevdim 🙃Yazar, Juliette'in içinden geçen ama söyleyemediği duygularının üstünü çizerek, çok değişik bir anlatım katmış kitaba. En çok bu hoşuma gitti. Sanırım seri ile ilgili esas düşüncelerim diğer kitapları okudukça şekillenecek."
213,2,"1.5★ | that note in the start of the book? Yeah, that's no joke.

215,3,"Re-read!“I am nothing but novocaine.I am numb, a world of nothing,all feeling and emotion gone forever.I am a whisper that never was.”Why does this book have so many 1 star ratings? I was going to read it when it first came out but after seeing all those reviews i kept putting it off. One night i couldn't help it, i just bought it on my Kindle and OH MY GOD! The very first line of the book got to me, that is all it took for me to get sucked into this rabbit hole.I was intrigued by Juliette, i wanted to know everything about her! Then we got Adam!I loved, loved Adam! He shocked me so many times (in a good way), i loved being on this journey with these two! I was surprised when we learned about their past, i was just swooning over Adam the whole time! He isn't sweet or cheesy.. he is very courageous and daring. You all know how much i hate ""ships"" but i really wanted them to be together!Then we met Warner!!And that's when Juliette and i parted ways. I was fascinated by him the second he showed up. He was crazy, and he only got crazier and crazier, i would be lying if i said i wasn't turned on by him. He was disturbing and eerie, but he did have this weird vulnerable side that i wanted to explore more. It was so satisfying how stubborn Juliette was, you don't get many of those in YA. At the end when she shot him... i applaud to you, Juliette, for not turning into another wobbly, uncertain MC. She just shot him, and took off with Adam. I wanted to get up and clap for her, i know i'm a horrible person. LMAO.I went into this book with no expectations, not low, not high, my mind was just a blank slate. I remember starting it at 8 pm and finishing it at 3 am, yes, it was that good. The writing style is so beautiful and unique, i never got bored for a second. I would read anything that Tahereh writes, that girl knows how to paint pictures in your mind, they aren't always pretty but they are clear, and it is so rear these days. I think it's safe to say I'm in love with her and would love to read more books by her. She is a fucking legend!"
216,3,"I was a little conflicted about how many stars I should give this.To be honest, even though Warner is a complete psycho, I liked the chapters with him the most. Every chapter without him felt a little dull. But his chapters was a 4+ ⭐️😏That said, I did read this fast, it's a quick and easy read. And I'm looking forward to the next one.. but then again, I just want to read more about Warner 😅Let's talk about the writing. I had to adjust to it, but I did really like it. It felt like being in the head of someone who has been alone to much and seen to much. But already thoughout the book, you'll see personal development in they way juliette thinks.I have a feeling there will be a lot more growth in her in the books so come.The plot, its still very confusing. In the way that a lot isn't answered yet. But that's okay, it makes sense, and it's obvious that you'll get more answers later. Guess I'll just have to be patient 😅Then let's talk about Adam. So he's very sweet, sems like a good guy.. and is so completely boring. I don't really care for him. Again give me some more Warner I'm so sure there is a lot more to Warner than meets the eye 😏.Okay and last, Kenji.. I feel a lot of potential here for a great and funny friend. He's got humor, and i love him."

Now I own the physical copies of the other two books and I can't wait to read them. I'm literally ecstatic about it. It was really well done. The writing as well as the narration.

223,1,"Added Feb. 4, 2014: Since native English speaker, Khanh, said my English was fine, I'm going to rate it. 1 star it is.----------------------------------------------------------------------***A bird, a cotton ball, raindrop, a toothpick and a falling sky, lonely moon and bitchy sun--stars***I have no clue how to rate this, so I won't, for now.DNF is almost always an automatic one star for me. But this book wasn't that horrible. Maybe it was good and brilliant. I wouldn't know, I could barely understand what it was about, because it was clogged with weird phrases and metaphors.I'm guessing she's blushing, since she wasn't lying in a bed of roses. But I'm not sure.The ninth and the tenth phrase was just weird. Reminded me a little of Real and The broken (I wonder if the writing in those two books can be called purple prose, too? :-)). Those books, too, were filled with nonsense like this. It's like saying ""He buzzes his nose into my temple"" or ""She literally eye fucked me"". You get the meaning, but it still doesn't feel right :-D.Then there was something wrong with her jaw.I read some of the metaphors and thought 40 minutes later, I'm eating dinner and thinkingI also wasn't sure what genre it was. The story is set in this post-apocalyptic world, but yet she has these superpowers.At times I wasn't sure if some of the things she said was meant to be taken literally or figuratively. Was she talking about a superpower that she has, or was it another metaphor that I didn't get?Does that mean she is bored and no one cares? Or she can manipulate time? I don't know…After I DNF-ed this book, I went to read some reviews and saw people kept comparing it to the X-Men. I didn't get why, so I decided to skim through to the end and see what was up with that. And what do you know, she ends up with a group of people, in some hidden place, where all have special powers :-D.This story is like some kind of mashup of X-Men and The Incredibles.Oh, and the constant echoing of words and sentences were very very very annoying!Oh, and the constant echoing of words and sentences were very very very annoying!Oh, and the constant echoing of words and sentences were very very very annoying!I learn two things from reading this book: purple (or any other color, type, shade) prose is not my thing. I hate it, with passion. And I learned that I need to take an English course, because most of the time, I couldn't understand what the hell was author trying to say."
224,5,"4 stelline e mezzo (perché le 5 piene me le tengo per i prossimi ... )La mia recensione sul blog http://www.leggereromanticamente.com/...Avevo in lista desideri questo romanzo distopico young adult già da un po', così, quando è stato pubblicato in questa nuova edizione, non ho saputo resistere e l'ho comprato al volo. La cover come l'originale è bellissima e cattura sicuramente l'attenzione, ma è l'originalità della storia e lo stile particolare dell'autrice a rendere questo libro unico nel suo genere.Shatter me è interamente narrato della protagonista diciassettenne Juliette ed è ambientato in uno scenario post-apocalittico. Quello descritto dall'autrice è un mondo in declino dove la terra sta morendo, il verde è limitato, gli animali sono una rarità (la protagonista ha la fissa di voler vedere un uccello...cosa che mi ha fatto sorridere più volte) e che vede al comando un movimento chiamato Restaurazione che dovrebbe sistemare le cose mentre sembra le stia solo peggiorando.La storia si apre con una Juliette rinchiusa in isolamento in una cella da un anno, in quello che poi si rivelerà essere una specie di manicomio. Ma la nostra protagonista non è affatto pazza, il suo unico “difetto” è quello di non poter essere toccata poiché il suo tocco potrebbe arrivare ad uccidere una persona risucchiandone la forza vitale. Juliette è una ragazza tormentata dai rimorsi e terrorizzata dal toccare qualcuno, ma allo stesso tempo brama il contatto umano perché non ha mai potuto sperimentarlo. È crescita in solitudine, senza conforto e amicizia, nemmeno da parte della propria famiglia che l'ha fatta rinchiudere per sbarazzarsi di lei. Juliette si crede un mostro e leggendo i suoi pensieri viviamo sulla nostra pelle la sua tristezza e sofferenza.È quando decidono di assegnarle un compagno di cella che facciamo la conoscenza di Adam, un bel ragazzo dagli occhi azzurri molto familiari per la protagonista, che non è esattamente quello che crediamo all'inizio, ma che non si può far a meno che adorare per i suoi modi di fare protettivi e per i suoi evidenti sentimenti verso Juliette. Inoltre, miracolosamente, lui sembra essere immune al suo tocco. Chissà perché ...Come in ogni storia c'è anche un antagonista e in questo primo libro della serie lo scettro spetta a Warner, un diciannovenne capo della Restaurazione, un ragazzo folle e pericoloso che stravede per Juliette e vorrebbe averla accanto a sé e fruttare il suo “dono”. Ho detestato Warner per la sua cattiveria e mancanza di scrupoli, ma in alcune scene mi ha fatto un po' pena, inoltre mi ha dato l'idea di essere uno di quei personaggi enigmatici e contorti che nascondono qualcosa e che potrebbero sorprenderci in un secondo momento.Tehereh Mafi ha uno stile tutto suo, utilizza metafore, ripetizioni di parole senza punteggiatura (a vote mi son chiesta se erano volute o meno, ma credo proprio faccia parte del suo stile e dell'intensità di ciò che vuole trasmettere a chi legge) parole o interi pensieri sbarrati che ci fanno provare in prima persona la confusione e la contraddizione di Juliette. Juliette è un personaggio interessante e ben riuscito che affronta un bel percorso di crescita già in questo primo volume, ma anche tutti gli altri personaggi creati dall'autrice sono ben caratterizzati e complessi. La trama di Shatter Me è ricca di azione, suspense e rivelazioni (soprattutto nella parte finale) ma non mancano l'amore e i sentimenti. Non so perché ho aspettato così tanto a leggerlo, una saga che inizia così promette davvero molto bene e io voglio leggere il seguito al più presto!Lettura assolutamente consigliata a chi piacciono i romanzi distopici con un pizzico di paranormal in stile X-Men!"
225,3,"“I've been screaming for years and no one has ever heard me.”I've decided to rate this 3.5 stars. I really enjoyed the book, but I have a feeling it's just touching the surface and there is a lot more to come.I really liked Shatter Me, I read it in one sitting. The premise was pretty neat, the protagonist was interesting and I really loved that we could hear her thoughts, it added a whole new element to the story and made me able to relate to her more. She seemed like kind of a delicate character - rather than a kick-ass and take no names heroin that we see a lot. Of course, she happens to have some cool power and I'm sure she is going to come into her own more over the next two books.The villain, Warner, was probably my favorite. He is pretty damn awful, but he is fun. I did think that he seemed much older than he actually was though, it's not really a complaint but if I didn't have an age for him then I would've guessed him to late twenties to early thirties. Just the vibe I got off him. Warner isn't someone I'd want to hang out with in real life, but this is a fictional world and in this world, I want this guy on my side all day long. He is certainly not going to be for everyone but I thought he had some great lines and a great presence about him. I also loved the side character, Kenji. He is most definitely the comic relief and probably a close second to who I enjoyed reading about. I hope he has a big part in the other books in the series. He might have had the most charisma in the book so far. also did a good job at setting up the world and how desperate Juliette had been feeling. I had no problem getting into it and at no time was I bored.I only have a couple of issues with this book. The first being Adam. Snorefest much! I couldn't get into his character at all. He just seemed like your typical cardboard cutout hero. I couldn't have cared less if he lived or died. Maybe a little harsh but he was just so ""meh."" I also thought the insta-love between him and Juliette was a little much. Yeah, I get it, they knew each other for years but seriously... It felt much more like an obsession/infatuation then true love. The last issue I had with the book was the writing style sometimes. It got tired for me. The metaphors, oh they starting hurting my head. I get the author was trying to be deep and eloquent, but I didn't really think it added to the story exactly. If anything it was distracting. I did adjust to the writing after awhile but I think this is one of those times that you will either love it or hate it.I will be reading the other books in the series, I've already purchased them. As well, as reading the two novellas. I do think I will enjoy the series in its entirety and I would like to see more works from Tahereh Mafi in the future."
226,5,"Original review from Little Book OwlFull video review found here: YoutubeThe plot is extremely captivating, dragging you right in to the story. I could not put this book down.I loved the writing style. It was beautiful, poetic, lyrical and very visual language. The crossed out portions of the book were very intriguing, enabling you to really get inside Juliette's mind and see what her true feelings and thoughts are.Juliet was a wonderful and strong main character who has been through someAdam started out a bastard, but you soon learn why this was and what his motives were.I loved Warner. He was a fantastic antagonist. He is pretty messed up mentally, but he was a very solid character. He had feasible reasons for his actions, and he was pretty much just a really evil character."
227,4,"Tal vez no tenga mucho que ver con cuestiones de contenido, pero la portada en la versión en español no es nada bonita, pero al menos eso fue lo único desafortunado de este libro.La autora posee una capacidad inmensa, la trama está muy bien llevada, la acción está presente y en cada página.Los personajes poseen muchos sentimientos, facetas y podemos empatizar con ellos con mucha facilidad, lo cual es otra cosa positiva.El romance aquí es un aliado, porque al mismo tiempo nos va planteando diversas situaciones que van dando clic de forma precisa y que nos van aportando con el avance de la lectura.Lo tiene todo: excelentes personajes, una historia pulida y muy bien lograda y una premisa que no te dejará respirar por lo fuerte que es, un libro que se devora sin importar que no seas muy fan de su género, porque logra la atención sin importar nada, y te deja con unos deseos intensos por saber más."
228,4,i absolutely did not forget how much i love the writing for this it has my entire heart——————THIS IS THE BOOK THAT GOT ME BACK INTO READINGthanks to that one tiktok that showed me the first line 🙇🏻‍♀️😭
229,4,"Shatter me⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️Despite the lack of world building, I’m here for it😁👏🏻"
230,4,I was expecting to be disappointed but definitely wasn’t and I hate myself for not reading this book sooner
231,3,"this book was pretty slow. i read the first half on audiobook and have been waiting for soo long to get the physical copy because this audiobook just wasnt doing it. and it was much better once i had the actual book but the first half was pretty bad. i had to force myself to keep reading multiple times but i have heard that the first ones slow and the others get better so i hope they do!!!‼️SPOILERS‼️imma start off with the charcters and before anything else i need to talk about kenji. i am in love with him. hes my fav already. hes the best. PERIOD. nothing else needs to be saidjuliette and adam- shes meh. i dont hate her but i dont get her. i despise adam. they both act like they’re SUCH good people and warner sucks but they’re not better….they both treated kenji like shit until they wanted something from him.and them as a couple, I CANT. they make me so frustrated because they tell each other they love each other, ask why the other person loves them and cry every five pages. i cant believe adam and juliette nearly had sex in the room beside a ten year old angel. james is the cutest frr🩷🩷 and can we talk about how juliette’s sooo obssessed with warner?? girlie is all like ‘adams so hot’ one second and then ‘i wonder if warners alive’ the next. she also spent soo much time complaining about her power and then felt sad about it when it wasnt working. ummm girlll what?aaron warner- i didnt like him in shatter me. and i didnt get why everyones so obssessed with him but after reading destroy me i started to get it. it felt really great reading his perspective and now i understand a lot of things better. i hate his father thoughh, i dont even wanna talk about his father.i love the whole idea of the rebellion and other people with abilities thing thats going on. it felt WAY too rushed though. i was reading about how juliette manipulated warner into thinking she wanted him and then shot him and all of a sudden theres this dude names castle introducing her to all that stuff.umm so yeah, thats everything for this book. i dont really have much rant-worthy material to work with lmfao. so, three stars…. but tbh i would’ve probably given it two stars if not for kenji <333"

233,4,**4.5 #TeamJuliette stars**MY TOUCH IS LETHAL. MY TOUCH IS POWERFUL.Juliette is broken and isolated from the world. She's been locked up because her family thinks knows that she is dangerous. No one can touch her.is a childhood friend of Juliette's. His mission now is trying to keep her safe while freeing her. He's joined the army so he can get close to Juliette and protect her from Warner.is powerful and in charge. He's the who won't stop until he gets what he wants. And he wants Juliette all for himself to use her gift of touch.Adam and Warner are opposite of each other in everything except that they share a fascination with Juliette and both of them have an immunity to her touch. Why can these two guys be able to touch her without dying?!Intriguing story line with a good mix of paranormal and fantasy. I'm curious to see where Ms. Mafi takes us.Continuing story.(#1.5)(#2.5)
234,1,"dnf'd at 60%I just couldn't give the required attention to the boring and repetitive dialogue, characters and the *coughs* plot*coughs* and storyline. As I said before, the world building was hilarious and actually makes no sense.I mean, how can there's scarcity of food, peace harmony, yada yada yada in like, 4-5 years? It fell out of nowhere. The ~only~ thing I enjoyedliked was Juilette's(did I get that name correct? idc, really) backstory and it was real sad. I somehow felt relatable :)However, the other characters are just bullshit. How can anyone tolerate his stupidity and nonsense for a-whole-book!? kjhfhsebkfkfgajwjkhawwbI'm seriously being tired of this so-called teen characters in ya books. It'd be much realistic if his age was somewhere at late twenties.I know my review makes no sense, it's just blabbering of words lol. Check out this review instead, I found it amazing:With that being said,"
235,1,"Behold, my first 1 star book ever.This was the most frustrating read of my life.I skim read the hell out of this.I am only reading the second and third book as I got them in a box set, I want closure and they’re so easy to read and the last couple pages were mildly interesting. 🤷🏼‍♀️The only thing going for this book is the cover.I can’t be bothered to give a proper review, the book doesn’t deserve it, it took my time and now I’m moving on."
236,1,"I didn't didn't didn't didn't like the book so much that I exploded, my brain formed petals which floated down to my toes the ground and after 72 73 74 hours it decomposed, taking every drop of my sanity with it.edit: 1.5/5"
237,0,"Okay. Since my feed is filled with updates about this series and a fourth book(?) - I think it's about time I finally gave this book a shot. But I was told by a few people that I trust that it wasn't good at all, so I don't know."
238,5,Still like Warner despite everything.
239,4,"That was so fun, such a quick easy read.I love Kenji he is my spirit animal 💞💞"
240,4,"God. I loved this book.GO AHEAD JUDGE ME I DONT CARE.To be honest, I was expecting to not like this book . And hadn't even planned on reading it because reviewers I trusted didn't like it. But I'm currently going through a wave of reading where I read popular YA and just go for it.And thank god I did because holy shit I loved this book.Let me first say why, and then I'll do a quick review of the book itself. This is gonna get personal so just skip this review if you aren't interested in that. Also, what I'm about to say is very dark so beware.So I had a very visceral reaction to this book, especially the beginning, which I thought was . In the past I've had extensive experiences with mental hospitals. I don't talk about it and basically I'm fine now but for a few years I was in and out of them. I tend to avoid books that are set in psych hospitals because it irritates me endlessly how they are conveyed. People don't just get to have romantic rendezvous in secret corners of the hospital and it's not a watered down experience. Authors try to make it endearing to the general public so that it's easier to swallow. It is not cute, it is not fun, it is not quirky and indie. You are monitored 24 hours a day, even when you are showering. Some treat you awfully. I would say about 50% of them do in my experience.I've seen horrible things and I won't go into it here. Basically if I had known this had a mental hospital scene ahead of time AND since its YA, I would never would have read it. Yet, I did. And honestly, I found the emotions Mafi displays through Juliette when she's isolated in the hospital is the closest I have ever read to the feeling of being in a situation like that. Obviously, the hospitals aren't as bad as this particular one is described, but THE FEELINGS are insanely accurate (no pun intended).Also, the metaphors and symbolism work perfectly. I've read that a lot of people had problems with the somewhat nonsensical metaphors, but to me they seemed perfect. Things do seem like hyperboles when you're there and things ARE nonsensical. I thought Mafi's writing was beautiful and poetic and evoked a lot of feeling without saying too much.Moving on. I loved the characters. Juliette was realistic and flawed and I loved her development and loyalty. Adam was devoted and understanding and I have a super crush on him. I loved the idea that she would be used for torture but she rejects. And mostly I love by the end of the book she discovers other people with gifts like her own.I was super nervous to keep reading at some points because I didn't want this book to start disappointing me.And I'm honestly really nervous about continuing the series because I don't want this to start offending me or me not liking it...I thought the kissing scenes were awesome. I'm a glutton for secret kisses and stuff.If I hadnt had these experiences, I don't know if I would have liked this book as much. But frankly, I have, so I'm not going to extrapolate if I hadn't."
241,4,"daje 3.5⭐️, bo czuje, że kolejne tomy będą jeszcze lepsze! Niesamowicie pozytywnie się zaskoczyłam i jeszcze nowelka na koniec - cud, miód. Chce już mieć u siebie dwa kolejne tomy!♥️"
242,4,"*** 3.5 Quiero que me Escojas STARS ***QUE LIBRO TAN MÁS ADICTIVO!!!Me he estado haciendo la difícil con estos libros por años, he visto tanto opiniones negativas como las que lo alaban. A demás que yo no soy mucho de leer distopías.Pero en serio este libro es como droga en cuanto lo empiezas te tiene pegado a sus páginas.No voy a negar que me gustó bastante sobre todo los primeros dos tercios del libro, era de querer saber que pasaba por que tiene un ritmo bastante ágil, ya el último tercio siento que bajó la intensidad.Este libro lo siento más como una historia de amor desarrollada en un entorno distópico que en una distopía con un toque de amor, porque no se enfoca en el gobierno opresor, en la población sino en Juliette y sus intereses amorosos y su capacidad de poder matar a la gente con el contacto de su piel y en como ella sobre por esa causa.Juliette al principio me tenía bastante intrigada con su supuesta locura, aunque es comprensible que esté en esa condición cuando ha sido confinada a un encierro de casi un año sin contacto humano. Pero después se me hizo como cualquier protagonista juvenil bastante tonta y después guiada por sus hormonas y supuesto amor a AdamAdam ¿Es raro que su perfección me parezca tan creepy? Este hombre es TAAAAAAN perfecto, siempre hace dice y hace las cosas correctas y hasta sus acciones dudosas siempre tiene una muy buena justificación que llegó a inquietarme que sea tan bueno me hace desconfiar.OHHH YEAH Warner, definitivamente los chicos malos villanos son mi tipo y él es totalmente mi tipo Sus locuras, villanías, su obsesión por Juliette era de dar miedo pero al contrario de Adam sé que él no se anda con medias tintas y sabemos que es lo que quiere.Me faltó conocer mucho de él, porque todo lo que sabemos es desde la perspectiva de la protagonista.Como dije al principio, el último terció me pareció bastante lento y aburrido y luego no sé en qué momento se convirtió en una especie de X-men combinado con los 4 fantásticos pero bueno y el final pensé que acabaría de infarto tipo NECESITO LEER EL SIGUIENTE, aunque si necesito leer el siguiente pero sin tanta emoción."
243,2,"(reread, 2 stars):well this was not the nostalgic reread i thought it would be. honestly, i could not wait for it to be over.i was skimming so much and skipping pages at a time because i really just can’t stand the writing. i don’t think it fits the genre, or the book in general.and it was also just.. really boring. adam is the most dry, flat, and one dimensional character i’ve ever read. he has no personality and there’s literally nothing interesting about him, so no scene with him in it was enjoyable.juliette was also a painful character to read, her thoughts were so bland and she just repeats the same shit over and over again. does anyone remember what colour adam’s eyes are?jesus christ even warner was intolerable. he’s written drastically different in the other books, and i just think it’s so weird that he went from seeming like her weird, delusional captor to her love interest. don’t get me wrong, i love him, but his “character development” was rushed like crazy so that people would like him.leave it to kenji to carry this book with the 4 lines that he had, though.(3.5 stars, original review, first read):i have a lot of mixed opinions, but i have high expectations for the second book.the writing:i actually didn’t mind the crossed out sentences and use of numbers. the numbers were a coping mechanism for her, and i didn’t expect her to just get over them after being in an insane asylum without human contact for a year. but the constant metaphors and poetic writing does get boring and hard to readjuliette:her character is very comforting, and i don’t have anything that i dislike about her besides her horrible choice in men.adam:he’s the first love interest that nobody actually likes, including me. everything between them happened way too fast, and their relationship started way too soon.i’m so interested to see how juliette’s relationships progress (especially with warner). i’d also really like to see her touch someone intentionally, and see how she views her gift later on in the series"
244,4,"reread #1me reading shatter me for the first time: ew warner gives me the ICK. he’s a walking red flag 🤢me rereading shatter me: now…this definitely is a red flag…HOWEVER…red is my favorite color 🥰💅bumping this from a 3-ish stars to stars because i genuinely enjoyed this way more than i did the first time around. the ending was a wee bit anticlimactic but i’ll forgive it simply because i know there’s still 5 books to goas always kenji remains my #1. i love warner and juliette but the that kenji has me is frightening.—————————————————————————Buddy read with :)So this might be an unpopular opinion but...that ending??? I'm so unbelievably ANGRY at. The whole book was incredibly fast pace and full of cliffhangers yet the ending was mediocre at best. No actually. It was dumb 👀 I'm all for chill and ""happy"" ending but that ending? It was anticlimactic, felt rushed, and overall made NO SENSE. There. I said it.Other than that I enjoyed the book and can't wait to read the rest. RTC tomorrow when I have time to put together my thoughts into a coherent review!"
245,4,"Waffled between 4 and 5 stars for this one…I really enjoyed it! Especially the stream-of-consciousness narration style - Juliette’s voice is unique and I have no problem feeling her emotions right through the page. Her isolation and self-loathing is tough to read at times. At the beginning of the story, we’re not sure how mentally stable she is, and the writing style helps create that tension in the reader’s mind as we figure out what’s really going on.The plot is definitely romance-focused, and the dystopian setting mostly serves as a backdrop for the characters’ relationships. Adam and Juliette have an instant connection because of their shared experiences as outcast kids. I’m still a little confused by Warner’s motivations…he seems personally obsessed with Juliette and wants to include her as part of some grand scheme that we don’t fully understand yet.I’ve read a few spoilers and I can already see a love triangle developing, but not sure how Tahereh plans to pull that off convincingly? Expecting this series to be a fun ride!The Fairyloot edition is especially the custom sprayed page edges. Well worth it for the collector of pretty books 😍"
246,4,"""Look at me, is what I wanted to say to you. Talk to me every once in a while. Find me a cure for these tears, I'd really like to exhale for the first time in my life""OH GOD. In this house we love and support Juliette and want her to be happy, healthy and successful love urself sisANYWAY THE WRITING STYLE IS CAPTIVATING AND ENCHANTING AND BEAUTIFUL AND REALLY ELEVATES THIS BOOK INTO SOMETHING BETTER THEN JUST AN AVERAGE DYSTOPIAN AND ALSO I CAN JUST FEEL THE NEXT TWO ARE GONNA BE A WILD ROLLERCOASTERI think it's soo interesting this is written as Juliette's journal because it allows for so much room for their to be things to be a little unclear and unreliable I literally LOVE unreliable narrationI READ THIS ENTIRE BOOK IN A 24 HOUR READATHON YEETREVIEW TO COME"
247,4,"Binge read this in 5 hours because of how intrigued I was.It definitely gives of basic YA vibes but you know what? I’m not mad about it.Though the writing wasn’t my favourite, the story was super good and did remind me of other 2010’s dystopian vibes books.I’m super excited to continue the series and find out how the heck the story gets to where I know it’s gonna go.4/5⭐️"
248,4,I liked it even more than I did the first time!!
249,3,did i understand the plot? no. do i understand the hype of aaron warner? yes.
250,5,UWIELBIAM. Totalnie wciągnęłam się w losy bohaterówReread: Kocham to jeszcze bardziej.
251,4,"Juliette hasn’t touched anyone in exactly 264 days.The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now.Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.And I did it! *happy dance*I’ve been meaning to re-read this book and the whole trilogy for a while now and the time has come.Let’s start with what I didn’t like about the book.Like most dystopian novels, Shatter Me falls into the category. Even though we are offered some information about the damage left in the world and what caused it that’s just it. We’re never told about the process, about the first major indicator or the first country to fall. And the thing is, with this book, the devastation is worth reading.As far as we can tell, it started with environment damage caused by the human population. The exact same thing , so the things the people in charge had to do in order to keep things to go any further, all the regulation, the beginning of the Reestablishment… that’s interesting. Why people have these powers? Was some virus in the air and mutated? Were they experimenting with genetic so they make sure some people survive?None of those questions were answered in this bookThat’s about all I didn’t like because the rest of the book?Tahereh’s writing style is so poetic and beautiful and instead of being heavy, it’s so fast paced and easy to read.I also liked , I think it’s a good indicator. How? Well, in the beginning, you can see how weak (?) Juliette is and therefore the way it’s written is full of scratched font and doubts but, as the story goes and she grows confident we see less and less . That’s quite interesting and great to read.Evolution is the key in this book and that’s something you can see through the pages.Yep, great character development.The plot is something we’ve already seen but I think is well driven and it gives the characters the space they need to shine.Now, with Warner, the bad boy syndrome strikes one more time. There isn’t a part of me that hates him. I just couldn’t. I don’t know if it’s because I felt there was more of him than what he shows.Plus, I admire his determination and he’s so sharp, intelligent, ruthless and hot. I love the guy even though there wasn’t much information about him,he managed to get my attention and he didn’t let it go. He’s just such an interesting character.And he’s such an asshole. God, I love himNow, Adam,Uh, how could I describe Adam? Y’all know I’m not a fan of him, never been, never will. It’s just he’s so… . He doesn’t offer me more than a possible crush and I don’t have a crush on himHe’s good people but he’s not for me. He wants sweet, good and all of that. He wants people and that’s not possible. Not in his world, not in ours. So maybe that’s why I never liked him that much. Can’t help it, I like my characters dark, volatile and crazy.Juliette is a different thing.She’s spent years in this asylum, away from human interaction but she didn’t have much of that to begin with. Since her “gift” appeared when she was a baby, she was always feared. An outcast. So, she knows little about being loved but despise that she has so much love to give. It’s amazing how caring she is. And how she sees the world, how she feels things.I’m also amazed by her powers. They’re so raw and powerful and beautiful. In a dark, deadly way but beautiful still. So much strength. I’m a sucker for power.I like the X-Men factor of the book, Juliette is like Rogue and there are others characters that are similar to the mutants. Ñom, ñom, Laura likes it.There are really likeable characters with snarky comebacks and they’re really fun to read.Overall is a really great book, a quick read with really cool characters. Plus, the writing style, again, it’s so beautiful. It’s one of my favorite trilogies right now."
252,3,"How to keep me hooked up:I’ve been locked up for 264 daysLike who wouldn’t be hooked up when the opening line That! Probably someone who is not me. This book intrigued me in many ways and I still can’t believe the author filled a page full of ‘I am not insane’ which made me go insane. The organisation at the end gives me Red queen vibes...I was a bit disappointed in the plot for there was none. There is a locked up girl whose name we find out at a really later stage of the book.She is given a cell mate who turn out to be someone she knows and they both act like they don’t know each other and there are some betrayals, torture, love, kisses and troubles. Human being messed up the planet Earth and are now suffering the consequences. No proper food, grey clouds, no birds, sick animals and even sicker humans (at least as far as they know😉). Your perfect dystopian story. An organisation called reestablishment true to its name tries to re-establish everything by destroying everything. They also try to find people like Juliette for I don’t know what reason because it’s not mentioned in the book. The plot was cheesy and bland and there was no story line. It felt like a badly written fan fiction. I hope it changes in the next book!Stop Environmental pollution? Accept yourself for who you are? You are not alone? Somebody on this earth will really love you? Don’t overuse Earth resources? Don’t try to shatter? Never give up? Be ready? You are not a monster? Somethings are not in our control? We may never know....I have so many questions... again! I literally have no idea what the world building is about. Some say Earth is damaged. Some say it isn’t. Wait... this doesn’t come under world building. I have no clue about anything. We had some kind of answer in Divergent. But nothing here!I am pretty sure I am clouding my judgement based on pity. I seriously feel bad for her! It stirs my soul🥺😢I cannot help but feel sad for her. Nobody deserves what she experienced. But I do feel her character to be a bit bland. There was not much to her that is worth praising for. She suffered a lot from the moment she was born. She is our MC. At the beginning she is this terrified, abused girl who has hatred for herself. She years to be a normal girl and wants to be loved and touched. By the end, I am satisfied by her character development. She come out of her learns to starts being more-happy? I guess. I want to see want happens to her in the next book.Our main love interest. The character who was also abused by his father suffered from a young age. A bit over-protective but alright. He is sarcastic and and caring and I ship him and Juliette! A lot! There is not much character improvement seen on his part. He remains the same throughout book but we learn he is a bit cunning.The villain. Or I hope he is the villain. The person I don’t understand AT ALL!! What does he mean to do with Juliette? What is his plan? He seems nice and cruel at the same time and that is not okay. This is not okay. I am not okay. He has the most complex personality I have ever seen. The perfect personality for a dangerous, handsome villain.I am going to share a few quotes....Exquisite isn’t it? Sometimes it’s boring but I loved it.I really really enjoyed this book and I hope you love it too. This books deserves it. Overall, I was satisfied! I am eager to find what the next book in the series holds!"
253,4,"Disclaimers: The synopsis section is ©Goodreads but the rest of the reviews are completely my words and of course the quote section is obviously from the book reviewed.4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐His smile is laced with dynamite. ""Go to sleep.""""Go to hell.""He works his jaw. Walks to the door. ""I'm working on it.""With the lovelies andJuliette hasn’t touched anyone in exactly 264 days.The last time she did, it was an accident, but The Reestablishment locked her up for murder. No one knows why Juliette’s touch is fatal. As long as she doesn’t hurt anyone else, no one really cares. The world is too busy crumbling to pieces to pay attention to a 17-year-old girl. Diseases are destroying the population, food is hard to find, birds don’t fly anymore, and the clouds are the wrong color.The Reestablishment said their way was the only way to fix things, so they threw Juliette in a cell. Now so many people are dead that the survivors are whispering war – and The Reestablishment has changed its mind. Maybe Juliette is more than a tortured soul stuffed into a poisonous body. Maybe she’s exactly what they need right now.Juliette has to make a choice: Be a weapon. Or be a warrior.With seeing so many reviews saying how terrible it was and then a few saying how it was; I had to read it.After the first chapter I was contemplating not even finishing it. The is kind of bothersome. It doesn't flow like a river it's like hitting brick walls every sentence.I never ended up liking Warner.The plot was so interesting though. Not knowing where she was or what was going on was irritating, but it made me really imagine her world. Tahereh Mafi had a mad driving plot and I live for it.The budding romance and friendships are just goals. I've heard many people say they hated Adam, but I ship him with Juliette. I'd die for this cutesy, cheesy, cliché romance. Romance has always been my forté, though.There's so many good quotes and smart-ass remarks. The badass comments and sarcasm is me through and through.Character development was kind of iffy, but the personalities made up for it."

256,1,"I continually had to stifle my gag reflex while reading this book. I'm actually amazed I managed to finish it. It has all of my least favorite things: lazy worldbuilding, an irrational (and overly sappy) romance, a boring protagonist and no other female characters. The beginning was tragedy porn, the ending was completely nonsensical, and absolutely nothing was developed (plot, characters, setting, romance). I'm sure this is someone's idea of a really great book, but it isn't mine. The only positive thing I can say about it is that I finished it really quickly--or rather, I skimmed it in barely over an hour."

I didn't expect it to be so gripping and addictive."

260,3,"(3.5 ⭐) Definitely my least favourite of the series, but James, Kenji and Warner make up for it ✨"
261,2,"Original review posted on The Book SmugglersAna’s Take:Shatter Me is Tahereh Mafi ‘s debut, a dystopian YA novel, marketed as a mixture of Hunger Games and X-Men. Although I am not really a huge fan of dystopians (at least not of this recent YA batch, I haven’t been particularly lucky with my choices) , I am a huge fan of X-men and this connection was enough to make me pick it up. That and the raving reviews this book has garnered for the past few months all over the blogsphere, some of them by trusted reviewers.It is the near future, the world has collapsed Juliette has been in solitary confinement at a mental asylum for 264 days. Her touch is lethal and a few years ago, she murdered someone by accident and she has been a prisoner ever since. Her keepers are The Reestablishment, the ones who are in control of this brave new world, in charge of saving humanity from the brink of starvation and death. The problem is: more than to lock her away for good, the Reestablishment might have other ideas on how to use Juliette as a weapon of torture.Shatter Me is out tomorrow and I believe reactions to this book will be extremely polarised and the main reason for this will be the prose. Tahereh Mafi’s writing is very descriptive, relying a lot on metaphors and imagery and the strike-through tool. For some, this will be unique and beautiful. To others like me, it will come across as excessive and irritating. Words can be very powerful and I feel this was the idea behind the prose but there is a difference between power and force – the writing to me, proved to be forceful instead of potent.At first, the use of strike-through and metaphors seem natural as a reflection of Juliette’s unstable state of mind and although the usage of strike-through words diminished as the story progressed ( as a clear result of the change in Juliette’s mental health), the metaphors kept going strong. The novel overflows with them. And in many cases, the metaphors didn’t even make sense. A few examples are in order:I’m wearing dead cotton on my limbs and a blush of roses on my faceI catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courageI blink and bottle my breathsNot to mention a lot of exaggeration:Hundreds of thousands of seconds pass and I can’t stop dying(this is a quote from a mere conversation Juliette is having and not say, a quote from a fight scene or a torture scene)I gasp so loud I’ve swallowed the entire room in one breathand so on and so froth. I am sure Thea will have more examples.The point is: I had a very strong, negative reaction to the writing and that definitely coloured my overall reaction to the book. But my problems with the novel went far beyond that. The story has definitely a good, strong premise especially when it came to Juliette. As a character on the brink of being driven insane by loneliness and starvation for human touch, she had a lot of potential. I do feel though this potential was wasted away by the need to constantly reaffirm Juliette”s goodness of heart. Her entire life she has allowed people to use her, to walk all over her and she has an undying love for human beings. I understand that part of it comes from her being insecure and lonely, but the hammering down of Juliette’s inner goodness is such that it goes beyond making her heroic and tips her over complete martyrdom. In terms of her powers, it is easy to see where the comparisons with X-Men stem from: she reminds me a lot of Rogue. However, in terms of characterisation, she is much more to the Rogue from the movies than the original Rogue from the comics. That is totally not a good thing, in case you were wondering as Movie-Rogue was a whinny, tearful thing whereas Comic-Rogue is complex and awesome.Moving on to other elements of the novel, there are two more aspects to be discussed. First of all, the romance. The romance is a very strong element of the novel, at some points completely taking over from everything else. I won’t dwell: suffice it to say that he romance is not the insta-love I despise but is my second least favourite trope, the “I have always loved you even though I never spoke a word to you” trope, which is equally irritating because it also throws away any need for developing a love story. Just like the insta-love, the always-love is inexplicably there. Not to mention how this seems to be latest YA book in which protagonists have a difficult time getting around to simply kissing. Eventually Juliette and Adam do get hot and heavy but their first kiss takes forever to happen even though they touch foreheads, kiss necks, kiss cheeks, kiss ears but without managing to properly kiss because apparently the mouth is MILES AWAY FROM THE CHEEK/NECK/FOREHEAD. I have a tendency to find this hilarious. And that is most certainly not a good thing either.Which brings me to my last point: the dystopian elements. It is a bit hard to believe that it has taken a mere three years for the Reestablishment to take over the entire world and rule it so completely. It is even harder to take these people seriously and fear them when one of their biggest leaders – in charge of an entire complex – is a 19 year-old psycho with delusions of grandeur and mommy issues. Warner is the villain of this piece and although he is the most interesting and complex character of the bunch, his excuse for wanting to use Juliette’s power as a weapon of torture is flimsy at best, because seriously what is the range of her power? One person at a time, and only if she is touching them. Seems like a bit short-sighted plan from someone who is supposedly extremely smart and ambitious.Despite a competent, claustrophobic start and a promising ending, the aforementioned problematic aspects were far too strong for me to really enjoy this book at all.Thea’s Take:I was extremely excited to read Shatter Me, having listened to the charming Tahereh Mafi speak at Comic Con this year, and having read a number of stellar reviews for this debut, I was thrilled to finally dive into this highly anticipated book.Unfortunately, I have to agree with Ana. I could not engage with the writing style of the book, riddled with nonsensical metaphors as it is, I could not find any foothold with main characters Juliette or Adam, and I could never buy the dystopia.The most glaring, off-putting thing about this book is the writing style, and as Ana points out, the most egregious of these problems is that of the distracting metaphor. There are a number of nonsensical phrasings, such as:My eyes break open. Two shattered windows filling my mouth with glass.orHis lips soften into a smile that cracks apart my spine.orThey filled our world with weapons aimed at our foreheads and smiled as they shot sixteen candles right through our future.orWarner thinks Adam is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations.In these instances the metaphors actually make no sense, poetic phrasing intended or no. How would eyes breaking open fill one’s mouth with shattered glass? How can a smile crack a spine? What the hell does shooting sixteen candles mean (this sounds like a John Hughes horror parody)? What is a cardboard cutout of vanilla regurgitations? What do these phrases purport to accomplish? Other than stringing together random words in an attempt to sound poetic and deep, there is no actual meaning ascribed to these phrases, which is incredibly irritating. Beyond these examples, there are also the use of the strike-through – which, unfortunately, also doesn’t ever seem to attribute any actual meaning or added value to the text (besides gimmickry). I get what Ana’s saying that this is meant to be indicative of Juliette’s mental health, but I just don’t buy it. For example:“What are you writing?” Cellmate speaks again.These words are vomit.This shaky pen is my esophagus.This sheet of paper is my porcelain bowl.andHe saved my notebook. Adam saved the only thing I own.Why does that sentence need to be struck-through? Often in the narrative, Juliette’s words are repeated and struck through, only to have her say the exact same thing. Furthermore, as the book wears on, the strike-through technique fades almost completely from the story, leading me to believe even further in the gimmicky nature of the device. It’s a shame, too, because this is the kind of thing that I love – I love experimental formats that construe meaning with form as well as content (Mark Danielewski’s House of Leaves immediately comes to mind as an excellent example of this). Unfortunately, Shatter Me feels like the victim of its own excesses.Beyond the problems of format, there’s also the blandness (or vanilla regurgitations?) of its main characters. Juliette is sickeningly saccharine, like Ana says, but as narrator, she’s also strikingly inauthentic. There’s a lot of telling in this book without showing (i.e. “Her lack of compassion as a parent devastated me and it reminded me too much of my own mother.“). This applies to the dystopian elements of the story too, as told through Juliette’s voice. We are given data-dumps in Juliette’s narrative about how the population was dying at an alarming rate before the Reestablishment took over and enforced their predictably totalitarian regime on the surviving vestiges of humanity. As far as dystopias go, this one is pretty standard with evil big government, dissenters thrown in jail, society militarized and homogenized, and so on and so forth. There’s no real emotion vested in this society, though, and the fact that a sadistic, cartoonish teenager is at the helm of the operation doesn’t help improve matters.Ultimately, I gave up a little over halfway through the book because I was exasperated with the overwrought, trying-too-hard writing, the lackluster characters, and the inherent silliness of the society. While Shatter Me might appeal to others, it is not the book for me. This, unfortunately, is one of my few DNFs of the year."
262,2,"For more of my reviews, visit my blog at: theblondelikesbooks.wordpress.comOh boy. Get ready for a rough ride. Where to even start. I hated I hated I hated the writing. I don't know why why why it was necessary to repeat everything everything everything a million times. The strikethroughs didn't make me want to burn the book didn't bother me nearly as much as the writing did and I can't I can't I can't understand why anyone in their right mind would write so annoyingly it was written like that.Now, if you made it through the paragraph above and didn't want to stab out your eyeballs or quit reading, good for you, you might be able to make it through Shatter Me, because that's exactly how it's written. Lots of repetition and lots of strikethroughs. I hated it. Shatter Me is about a girl named Juliette who is locked up in an asylum because her touch can kill. Literally. She hasn't talked or touched anyone in almost a year after accidentally killing someone. Shortly after we meet Juliette, we meet Adam - another prisoner who is put in her cell. Adam updates her on their dystopian world, and she learns that The Reestablishment is stronger than ever, and that people are wanting to rebel against them. Juliette's power of being able to kill someone with her touch could prove very useful to them...So I have to just preface this and say that I feel awful writing this review, because I had a LOT of problems with the book. That said, the book's average rating on Goodreads is 4.02 with over 180,000 ratings, so I am in the minority and you should take this review with a grain of salt.I won't spend a ton more time talking about the writing style, because I already did, and I don't want to harp on it. I think you get the point. I do want to mention one other thing about the writing before I move on. The sentences and METAPHORS. They were so over the top that some of them didn't make sense. They were SO flowery. Here are a few examples:Oy. It was rough to get through it, I'm not going to lie - I thought this might have been my first DNF in a really long time. Okay, moving on from the writing.There were a few other things I had an issue with. One was the world building. Well, the lack of world building anyway. I felt like we were really thrown into the world without any real explanation of how it got there and why. I didn't like that. I kept waiting for it to be explained, but it just never was.Next, there was definitely some insta-love happening with Adam and Juliette. It felt like it was missing the natural progression of things, and it went from 0-100 in like, 2.47 seconds.SO now that I've ranted a LOT, I do want to say a few positive things. Number one: I did like the characters fault. While I hated the writing, I liked Juliette and I liked Adam, and wanted to know what was going to happen to them. I've heard that the books get better after the first one, so I'm really torn on whether or not I want to read them. Is the writing the same as it was in the first book? Someone help me out!Next, there was one quote in the book that I LOVED which was which might be the most relatable quote from any book ever. I loved it so much that I actually bought a phone case with the quote on it from Evie Seo's Society 6 store.Alright, so this may have been the longest review I've ever written, BUT I felt like it was important to be totally honest with my thoughts on the book given how many 5 star reviews it has. I figured there should be a minority opinion in there somewhere. Anyway, if you loved the book, I'm sorry I didn't! It just wasn't for me. I thought about giving it one stars, but since I did like the characters, I decided to give it two stars instead. But just barely.SO what do you think? Have you read the book? If so, what were your thoughts?"
263,5,"To say I want to KICK MYSELF for waiting so long to read this is the understatement of the year.I fell in love with everything about it. With the characters, with the storyline, with the poetic detailed way it's written, strike-outs and all.I love picking up a book and being immediately immersed in the world the author creates. I love it even more when each and every character is so unique, so refreshing, and make me fall instantly in love with them. And this right here is one of those stories.I won't waste anyone's time with plot details, especially considering I am one of the few humans left who hasn't read this yet.Just know that I found it thrilling, addicting, found the writing absolutely stunning, couldn't put it down, and I am fairly certain this will become a favorite series of mine."
264,4,"Wait hold on, why so many people dislike this book?Like the writing is quite pretty, the characters are so interesting and the story too. And why EVERYONE hates Juliette? I don’t know but I really enjoyed this read and I was hooked from the very first pagesSoo good"
265,5,"Rereading this before the next book comes out because I just remember not liking Adam, Juliette in superhero tights and liking Warner even though he is evil or something? 🤷‍♀️"
266,4,"Es difícil reseñar este libro, ya que me he leído todo tipo de distopias y cuando haces eso, llega el momento en que todas crees que son iguales, pero me atreví a leer estos libros, quería algo que me quitara el horroroso sabor de ""La Espada de Cristal"" así que dije porque no? La mayoría de mis amigos de aquí ya la leyeron y les gusto. El problema fue que me hice algunas expectativas, algunas no me defraudaron pero hubo otras que no fueron de mi agrado. No había leído ningún tipo de spoiler sobre esta historia, quería ir en blanco y eso también fue un factor, que hasta ahora no se si fue bueno o malo. De alguna manera siento que me decepciono un poco.No me malentiendan, me encanto la narración, me encanto el mundo que creo Tahereh Mafi, el problema que tuve fue con algunos de sus personajes.Juliette... Juliette... Juliette, al principio me encanta, conecte muy rápido con ella, el problema que tuve es que a mitad del libro lo que decía se me hacia repetitivo y eso llegaba a sacarme de mis casillas, aparte de que me fastidio un poco el instalove que tuvo con Adam, como que sucedió muy rápido y se volvió una adolescente calenturienta enamorada. También tuve un grave problema en como trataba a Warner, es que... yo sentía mas sincero a Warner que a Adam y eso fue algo que no soportaba, era como NO TE DAS CUENTA?!! Aunque bueno tengo la esperanza de que con el paso de la historia esto cambie.Adam... lo siento pero a Adam lo siento falso de principio a fin, es que todo eso del amor a primera vista y como sucedió todo, no me da buena espina, con toda esa mierda cursilera, me llega a dar asco, como que de alguna manera siento que solo la desea sexualmente (y si, el amor que tanto profana no es verdadero) y tengo el presentimiento de que se obsesionara hasta convertirse en un lunatico demente. Incluso el libro se me hizo incomodo a la mitad, cuando empezó el romance. IUCK!Y Warner... lo malo de este personaje es que no te deja ver como es en realidad porque como Juliette narra la historia no podemos verlo como es en verdad, pero en mi tuvo el efecto contrario que Adam, Warner siempre me pareció sincero, aunque tampoco confiaba mucho en él, con esa obsesión hacia Juliette, quisiera que Warner tuviera un mayor protagonismo en el próximo libro.Creo que mi problema es que estoy esperando demasiado de las distopias últimamente y eso hace que les exija más y tengo que entender que las distopias nunca llegan a ser perfectas. PERO sin duda Shatter Me me quito el mal sabor que me dejo ""La Espada de Cristal"", logro su cometido. Leeré esta historia hasta el final, me ha enganchado lo necesario y quiero que los siguientes libros se superen, espero en verdad que el primer libro sea el eslabón débil de la saga."
267,4,"“All I ever wanted was to reach out and touch another human being not just with my hands but with my heart.”---I AM IN LOVE.The moment I started reading this book I couldn't put it down. What a page-turning, captivating story!Juliette. My dear Juliette. I LOVE HER. She's so strong, I love her power, how she's always quite and calm on the outside, but a burning inferno inside. No joke, I felt so bad for her, I cried. This world doesn't deserve her. If I had access to this world, I'd destroy everything bad to make it a better place for her.I watched thousands of Tikoks about how hot and perfect Warner is. ARE YOU JOKING? He's a psycho, trying to get his hands on my dear Juliette - I mean I see the tension between them, but I CANNOT understand it. Adam - even though I wasn't always sure if he's a good guy - is so caring and I love JAMES! Such a sweet boy.While reading this book, I never could really say what was going to happen next. Sometimes I had a foreboding, but I never was 100% sure. I already know there is going to happen so much more, there will be character developments and plot-twists.I'm VERY excited for the next book and how everthing is going to develop!!"
268,4,"Toliko sam se naslušala negativnih utisaka o ovoj trilogiji i zato kad sam je počela bila sam malo prijatno iznenađena, jer su mi očekivanja bila zaista nikakva. Celokupni utisak nakon pročitane prve knjige je dobar. Solidna priča, ima dosta prostora za poboljšavanje i baš me zanima u kom smeru će da krene radnja. Džulijet mi je i dalje dosadna, cela priča je iz njene prespektive tinejdžerke pa samim tim stil pisanja je na mene delovao uspavljujuće(bukvalno sam zevala na nekim delovima). Išlo mi na nerve što je fokus priče uglavnom bio na njoj i Adamu. Adam mi deluje kao dobar lik, ali totalno nezanimljiv. Dok sa druge strane, Vorner je vauu - seksi negativac, uvek bih živnula kad bi se on pojavio u nekoj sceni. Bukvalno me želja da saznam što više o njemu držala svih 284 stranica. Još nisam zadovoljena. Želim više, imam osećaj da kod njega ima dosta više nego što se čini na prvi pogled."
269,4,i enjoyed this book so much! i love the dystopian setting in this plus i wanna know why everyone is loving warner guess i’ll find out in the other books😋. poor juliette though she cant touch no one or else she kills them i cant even imagine. the scene with the little boy in the grocery store was so sad🥲. also i just gotta say i LOVE kenji! he’s so funny LMFAOO. overall this is a really interesting book so i’m planning on continuing this series😋!
270,3,"this is a book i thought i'd give 5 stars but as the story progresses, i wasn't really enjoying it :( i was practically skimming and most of the characters gave me the ick 😭 plus, insta love and love triangle tropes are not for me. i also hated this kind of writingwritingwritingwriting😬but i liked warner tho! and the short chapters :D"
271,5,"Loved this! Everything about it was just so interesting and the storyline kept me wanting to know more throughout the book. I think the characters were developed quite well and that the style of writing was so interesting. I am so excited to start the next book, definitely Team Adam!"

274,2,"This book is for you if… (I meant to say a younger reader but now realise how ignorant that is. Just because people are young doesn't mean they're impressionable or have 'bad' taste). I just am really weary to recommend this to anyone. I don't want to contribute to you wasting your time that could be spent reading something far bette.⤐ Additionally.Well, that's a lot of hours I'm never getting back 😤 It would be an exaggeration to say was torture. The story itself was okay-ish. I found the and I just couldn't get over it. At all.The . I had a and was, frankly, quite irritated by her constant doubts and insecurities although a part of me is quite aware that they are warranted. I felt like 16-or-however-old-she-is years of being bullied and discriminated for a power she can't help should have given her sort of shell at least.To make matters worse, . I suppose it was the author's intention to paint him as extremely disturbed(or -ing), vicious and mean-spirit, but it turned out to just be . I couldn't take any of what Warner did seriously and had trouble seeing his behaviour as a contributing factor to a decent narrative. Just pulled everything further down the drain.Unfortunately, that's not all I've gotta say. . I know it sounds odd but just let me give you some examples, that are, in my opinion, far away from prose and very close next to C O N F U S I O N:These are just a couple of the weird metaphors, similes or whatever-they-are-called I found. Unbearable.I mean;: If you haven't gotten through yet, you probably don't know what Ben's talking about now. But worry, not you won't understand it fully even after you've read the book._____________________"
275,0,"Update:Okay so I am going to finish this book. I know. No one is more surprised than me, myself and I. But I am literally so done with the hype surrounding Aaron Warner. Let's see what this man has got. Fingers crossed.Dnf at 20%Because life is simply too short to spend time on books that you despise, even if they are insanely famous.I tried, I really tried but I can't understand the hype for this series. Okay, maybe it gets better but I can't find the will to go on with this childish writing. It's like the author was trying so hard to find unique metaphors so she just strung a bunch of them in every sentence whether they made sense or not.So instead of her skin, her bones are begging for touch. How does that work?Lackadaisical ennui of the sun?!! How in the multiverse does that make any sense?And here I thought nothing was worse than the of Wattpad. 2 buckets of rainwater tops that ig.Don't even get me started on how those numbers and strike through sentences annoyed the life out of me.Why didn't she write two instead of 2, three instead of 3 and five instead of 5.Don't know about them but 10,000 particles did shatter in me, making me want to throw my phone across the wall.Anddddd....the repetitions. I don't think they produced the effect Miss Mafi was aiming for.Is there something on his lips?While doing all this, the author clearly forgot to focus on the dialogues.I am so grateful I didn't follow through my plan of buying physical copies of all the books in this series. 😭"
276,2,"2.5 STARS!Gotta say, there wasn't much that didn't annoy me with this book. It is full of cliches, which I guess at the time would have been quite popular, but I just found cringe-worthy. I also thought a lot of things were awfully convenient for the story line to progress. Her touch kills everyone BUTthe two MAIN GUY CHARACTERS?! ehhh yeah, don't believe it.Also not sure why one guy seems to hold so much power in a world where I'm sure it would be more chaos than it is. We get hints that there are rebel groups acting but barely anything seems to actually progress with them.This is also definitely a love story, everything else takes a backseat. Now, I know who the end game is so let me tell you how confused I am about this.My biggest complaint was with the way it was written. I'm not sure who decided that forgetting to use basic punctuation was okay, but it was beyond annoying. The mix of stream of conscious and weird lyrical descriptions made me feel like I was tripping through the world rather than experiencing it for real. It made Juliette seem insane, even though we are told time and time again she is not. It did nothing for the story and ended up annoying me more than anything.What did I like, you ask? Well, the ending seemed promising and Adam is pretty cool. That's about it."
277,1,"What the fuck did I just readThis book made me cringe so hard my face still hurts. And here are a few reasons why I disliked Shatter Me as much as I did;Most of the metaphors were horrible:""I catch the rose petals as they fall from my cheeks, as they float around the frame of my body, as they cover me in something that feels like the absence of courage.""???????????????????""I want to taste the landscape of his body."" (This almost made me throw up)""I melt until I'm a handful of butter dripping down his body.""??????????????????????????????????????? NO. JUST NO.Also, all of Juliette's sentiments are so exaggerated, you can't even take her seriously. Examples:""Hundreds of thousands of seconds pass and I can't stop dying.""“I’ve realized I’ll probably never exhale in his presence.”""I gasp so loud I’ve swallowed the entire room in one breath.""Excuse me?!But this wasn't the only thing that annoyed the hell out of me. WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE CROSSED OUT SENTENCES? It was confusing, annoying and unnecessary.Another thing that bothered me was that even though this book is supposed to be Dystopian, I didn't feel like it was????????????? Sure, there was a (poor) description of the world the characters live in, but that didn't satisfy me and it sure as hell doesn't make it Dystopian. It was a love story, actually. (Insta-love alert) And the romance made me want to throw up but I think I already said that.Don't even get me started on the characters. I hated all of them except Warner."
278,4,"I really liked Shatter Me and I really hope that the next books get even better from here!The only issue that I had when I was reading the book (and it was a minor, minor issue at that) was that I wanted to know more about the world we were in, and less about the romance that could have been developed more and taken more in depth within the next two books. I would've really liked a solid groundwork of this dystopian world that we've apparently created ourselves to better understand the events of the book, and more of Adam and even Warner later!BUT aside from that one little thing, I did really enjoy this book! When I went into this I knew that Adam, and ESPECIALLY Warner, were huge characters that everyone loves to death. When I first started reading, I had NOT expected them to be who they actually were in the book. Warner as a crazy, borderline psychopathic leader of The Reestablishment? Had not expected that AT ALL. But it made the story more interesting, that's for sure! In addition, I liked Juliette, but she wasn't my favorite character, and I really hope that I grow to love her more throughout the series.Tahereh Mafi's writing style was really different too, and I really enjoyed it! I loved how her use of the slash tool thing kind of went with Juliette writing in her notebook! And the metaphors, OH GOODNESS. So beautiful!"
279,4,"frick y'all, i FINALLY finished this book and it wasn't as bad as I expected!I feel like this book is one of those books that you feel trashy for liking? I'm glad the German Who Can Speak Four Languages forced me into reading this :)--if this book is bad then... i won't be surprised tbh. but that cover is so pretty!!!buddy read with my friends , , and"

281,1,"You know when you first read a book and you think it is heaven served in a plate? You know when you re-read a book and you think ""what the hell was wrong with me when I first rated this book""? Well, that happened to me.Two years ago, a friend of mine recommended this book to me because she said that everything was perfect on it, that there was a dystopian society, a slight romance and a paranormal touch. You know, what would make a book really enjoyable (or at least tolerable). The thing is, when I first read it, I thought it was fascinating, I thought it was one of the best books I had read, I thought it was amongst my favorite books, I thought many things I don't think any more about this book.is about this girl, Juliette, who has this special power, she kills people with her touch, and is considered a monster by everyone, including her. She has been locked in some room for a year or so when she finally gets to see a human being again: A guy. A guy her age. A hot guy. A hot guy that turns out to be the only one who can touch her. Pretty cliched, isn't it?Then, things get better: The ""bad guy"" appears. I have to confess something here: I liked the ""bad guy"", Warner (at least a little). He was handsome, a little maniacal, an asshole, a jerk, a _______________ . I was surprised I would like him at all, but well, you can't really choose what to love, can you?, leaving the hot guys aside, let me discuss the plot...It was interesting the fact that there is a secret society full of people like Juliette. Or well, not exactly like Juliette. What I meant is that there are people who also have ""special powers"".We are promised a dystopian book, but what we really get is a paranormal romance. I mean, there was the complicated things about the society (which name I don't remember. I just know it starts with “R”. Was it “The Reestablishment”?), but it gets on the backgroung, .Right from the beginning of the book, we see Juliette (again, I have to cry for that name, because I really like it) alone and in the next page *poof* Adam appears *rolls eyes*. They instantly have a connection and after a few more pages, she discovers he can touch her.OHMYGODOHMYGODOHMYGOD!!! HE CAN TOUCH HER!!! THAT'S SO ROMANTIC!!*rolls eyes*The insta-love is so ridiculous I wanted to break my skull. I don't really know what I hate more: The insta-love, or the love triangles. Hell, this series managed to have all the things I hate . Sigh.I like her name, which is a shame, because I hated her. She was stupid. She is supposed to be a strong character, but the thing is, . She is weak, she is foolish and she is annoying. She was always like this:Ugh.I will not elaborate on this one. I'm just going to say that he was annoying . He's also cliched as hell, and I hate cliched characters and books.Also, it had a ridiculously purple prosed writing. I don't call them metaphors, for they're nonsense. For example, look at this:Whaaa...? Do you understand that? I mean, what does the guy have to do with the moon? Then, this one:See what I'm talking about? This is just nonsense. It doens't make any sense. Am I supposed to drool over that line? Is that supposed to be good, beautiful and poetic writing? Hell no.I hated every word in this book. I wish I could go back in time and tell my 2012-2013 self what was wrong with me. I wish I could tell her how naive she was, and how stupid she was. I wish I could make her reason.Anyway, the premise still sounded (, there's the key word) interesting enough for me to continue reading the series until the end. It improved a little with the second book, but then it fell like a cascade (Heh, I used a Juliette-metaphor)."
282,4,"When you start a series blind, the result of actually liking it is thrilling. This was exactly what happened with ""Shatter Me"" because I vaguely remember reading something about it and one day I just decided to give it a try. No questions asked. I am very happy of this idea and I will continue reading it, because the plot is great and of my liking.We find Juliette, a teenager with special gifts. She can't touch anybody without hurting or killing them. At the age of 14 she was sent to an institution by her parents and received heavy treatment that included medicine, torture and shocks. She lives in her own world, believing no one will help her escape. Her hope is lost and her inner voice is shattered, thinking people like her don't deserve to be happy or loved. One day, in her chamber, a young man is let in and the 2 become room-mates. His name is Adam and he seems very interested in getting to know Juliette. Surprisingly, Juliette lets him in, begins to talk and the 2 of them bond rapidly, actually falling in love. When Juliette will find out that Adam is not who she believes, she will have to trust him and make a leap of faith, that can be her path towards freedom. Memories will be triggered and Juliette will realize that this is not the first interaction she had with Adam.""Shatter Me"" is exciting, thrilling, with great characters and narrative style. This is my first Tahereh Mafi book, but I liked it greatly because her style is unique. Her sentences are long, lyrical, that might confuse you sometimes, but they actually make sense. The melody of them won my heart and explain soooo much of the feels and thrills of the book. It is something distinct, which I have never experienced before, but I would be thrilled to keep on exploring because it managed to surpass words and transmit deeply. Juliette is special and I had the vision of reading something cut from X-men. She is like this teenager/super heroine who discovers her powers and has to decide if to use them for good or evil. Her love for Adam is the trigger in this plot and he will lead her in a journey of loyalty and decisions that will keep you amazed and excited. Even if she might be young and slightly confused, because her interaction with the outer world was limited, she was very persistent and keen of her desires and beliefs. She will do anything to not betray and she will follow Adam into a new future which can mean so much for the 2 of them. We will see her interact with many other characters and her personality will grow and shift throughout the book. We still have much to learn about her. Clearly I loved the book, but I wanted to see more of Juliette and Adam and their adventures. I know book 2 will have so much more in store, so looking forward to reading it quickly. 4 stars!!For more reviews please visit"
283,1,"After hearing alot about this book , after seeing so many people buying it and going crazy and what so ever , I decided to read it , and oh my this book was so disappointing.First of all , there’s no world building, like , at all , I couldn’t imagine anything and i still don’t know what the government is doing other than being evil . It’s not enough!!! A book without world building gets boring you know ? It was more about the romance and the guy crush then the actual story /action .Second of all , oh my , the characters are so lame . The main character juliette is so cringy .she’s whining all the time, calling her self weak . She’s a total idiot to be honest . I don’t like her at all . She haven’t seen herself in the mirror for 3 years ,I didn’t even know how she look like until past half of the book . She keep saying that she want to be killed , and falls in love with every guy she meets ? Not precisely but oh god i get it he has blue eyes and a hot body (she said it like a2837292 time)and you can’t control yourself around him, like shut up , get a grip on your self, get a life you’re only 17 and you’re dying over a guy . The other characters are craps and so badly written .Third, we have the lousy love triangle .Listen, the girl is insecure and haven’t eaten well and stuff like that but still managed to get all the hot dude’s attention? And the insta love thingy oh my god the cringe , like oh my god people , at least talk to each other !!! It’s so cliché, all she ever think about is “oh my god his lips oh my god his eyes his body blablabla” i swear to god she mentioned lips and breathing and kissing in every chapter (and there’s 50 of them ) the 2 boys are (hot ? ) even tho she only just met them but she managed to describe how sexy they are .Fourth, the writing?This is personal, but the writer used so many metaphors i was going to puke . The first person prov was badly written especially because the main character is a 17 whinny years old who only cares about kissing obviously , and who thinks alot and doubts alot and i really didn’t care about her thoughts ,not enough action, not enough of anything tbh , it wasn’t enough, what was that ?? Plus , the author repeats so many phrases and words , this was bad , i hated it , i was constantly rolling my eyes ! Boring , crapy , insta love triangle that didn’t make any sense, bad, bad , bad .I know they say it gets better after the first book , but I’m not planning on reading the sequel anytime soon . Sorry !"
284,3,"This first book in the sci fi/dystopian series was not all that I was expecting, and I left it feeling a little disappointed.Also, although I wasn't ""spoiled"" for anything in the book, it is a well known fact that the fandom hates Adam and loves Warner. So, this book was difficult to get through with Adam being such a main character and knowing that something is going to happen to ruin the image we get of him in this book. (Not that I liked him anyway...)WHAT I LIKED:-The writing is beautiful and didn't feel like I was reading a YA novel based on the writing.-Juliette. I see a lot of potential in her character and I am very interested to see where she takes us.-Warner. What a wonderful villain. His way of speaking and demeanor, although we saw little of it, was still such a treat.WHAT I DISLIKED:-Adam. As I said before, I already know something is going to go down with him, even though I don't know what it is, and as such, I cannot trust him.-The INSTALOVE. Really?! I understand the poor girl has had no one touch her, but her obsession with him was part of the story I hated the most. She was such a more complex character when her thoughts weren't revolving around him.-The lack of world building. It felt like a very basic dystopian premise without much explanation.-Lack of characters. We really only got to see Adam and Juliette, with a few other characters mixed in that weren't really developed. Even Adam and Juliette were mostly wrapped up in each other, as I said before. This lack of character development seems common in the first book in a series and may just be something I should get used to... (nope.)Overall, I didn't enjoy this book like I thought I would. I was more slogging through it in order to get to the rest of the books in the series, because I know so many fans of this series cannot be crazy."
285,3,"I didn't love it. I didn't hate it. I honestly just didn't feel much for it. I liked it enough but I didn't feel invested in it. I finished the book not really feeling attached to any of the characters but I'm intrigued to see what happens next as the last quarter did begin to catch my attention (I also just really want to know why everyone loves Warner?!) I felt as though the whole book was building up to something but when that 'something' happened, it was a little anticlimactic. I didn't feel at all invested in the romance, it just happened so quickly (but felt as though not much happened?) Tahereh Mafi's writing style took a little while to get used to as I haven't read anything like it before but it was interesting! Having said all this, I do think I will read the next book in the series as I felt Shatter Me was a good set up for the next book. Overall I was left disappointed by Shatter Me but I'm not sure whether that's wholly down to how high my expectations were, due to the amount of hype surrounding it."
286,2,"So not related to books BUT I've heard so many people on goodreads say they ""love Warner so much"" and talk about how awesome he is.My 4 y/o niece (for some reason) decided to nickname my baby nephew ""Warner Kitty""... so honestly i just don't know how to react to this except pull a weird face."
287,4,wow. honestly i’m bare angry at myself for waiting so long to read this.
288,5,"*Please note: The quotes used below are taken from an Advanced Review Copy of the book. The content may differ in the actual published version.When I began reading 'Shatter Me' I wasn't too sure what to expect. It helped that only two of my fellow Goodreaders had read the book, one who loved it and one who didn't love it, so I went into it feeling fairly neutral and open minded.I will say here and now that I was absolutely hooked from the very first line. This review will be a long one - there are so many passages that gripped me, and I want to share them with you. Tahereh Mafi has such a beautiful writing style - it was lyrical, so different and unique and utterly original. I loved the way she was able to convey Juliette's conflicting emotions, you know, head versus heart, or ""this is what they tell you but this is how it is"", with the way she struck out words or lines, for example;The way she described emotions and feelings by comparing them to nature conjured up some gorgeous imagery, and she did it in such a great way, constantly leaving me entranced. A couple of examples;Sometimes sentences are long and without commas which I had initially thought was a grammatical oversight, however I was quick to realise it was just a tool to allow the reader to grasp Juliette's reactions and better understand her emotions. Words were repeated when she's nervous, excited, scared etc.;(go figure which of the three this is, ha!)I think this is something that readers are going to either love or hate. I personally am for the former, I just felt as though it made Juliette feel that much more real, it was clever. Everything flows, the transitions are easy, I just couldn't get enough of it.When we are first introduced to Juliette, she is broken. She has been kept locked away, in solitary confinement, for 264 days. She was trying to help an innocent person and despite her good intentions, they ended up dead. She feels so alone, her thoughts are filled with sorrow and fear - my heart broke for her. Despite everything she's been through, though, she's so . She doesn't hate, yes, she's confused, but she is still so human. She doesn't wallow in self pity, she just wants change. She wants to love. She wants to feel wanted.feelAs you would expect, there is, of course, a bad guy here. His name is Warner. He's evil, he's manipulative, he's sleazy. His father is the leader of a group called The Reestablishment - the group who have taken control of the population, the food, resources and government. The Reestablishment had come in guns blazing, taking over in an effort to convince the masses that their way was the only way to survive. Without much else to do and having little way to fight back, society crumbled - what with diseases destroying the population, food being hard to find, the absence of birds that fly, and clouds that are the wrong color.Warner believes that by 'saving' Juliette from a life in a cell, by convincing her to help him torture trouble makers, he will gain better control over the people. He is cold and harsh and craves power. Everything a bad guy should be. The thing is, he's 19 and incredibly good looking. If you weren't so repulsed by him, you'd be attracted to him. I personally hated the guy. As the book progressed though, his layers (if you will) are peeled back and you begin to understand him and the reason for his actions better. I actually ended up feeling a little sorry for him.loveyouI'm very interested to see where things go with him in book 2.Of course, what good is a young adult book these days without a swoon worthy male? Cue Adam Kent. Adam is a complex individual, with a past as emotional and upsetting as Juliette's. He's gorgeous, sensitive, toned and tough. He’s compassionate and caring and has secrets of his own. He and Juliette have a past, not the kind you may think. I don't want to delve into it as it was such an emotional story, revealed in bits and pieces, something that I want everyone else to have the opportunity to learn themselves.I honestly loved this book. I cannot wait for more, I mean, the ending was great but wow! Hurry up book 2! Such a great debut for Tahereh Mafi, I can hardly believe that it is only her first published book."
289,4,"After months and months of been in the biggest reading slump of my life thanks to my Goddess, Sarah J. Maas, I finally read Shatter Me and I'm so intrigued.I don't know why the hell took me so long to read it because this book is clearly something... else. Like I was so confused half of the time but I enjoyed it! XDI have never read writing like this, I really liked it. I will be honest and said that the first chapters I was really not having any of Juliette's narrative. Like, she was super dramatic -she exaggerate with the time a lot- and I just wanted that she could talk normally but then I really enjoyed the way she thinks.I really like the way she thinks, the way her thoughts are formed. The way she thinks is something else, because you can read what she's denying to herself, is as if she can't control her voice of reason.In other news,Look, I can see a drama queen when I read it. Juliette is so dramatic some times and I'm so here for this XD but I really feel that she is going to be naive in some sense and OMG! I don't want to trust in no one but good lord, Adam is so perfect right now.At first Adam is kinda an asshole, he steals her bed and pillows when he just introduced himself as her cellmate. But then he gives her back her stuff and he's constantly wrapping her in his blanket and I WAS SO THERE FOR HIM!But then, we meet Warner and we learn that Adam was never an inmate!Talking about Warner! DUDE, I HAVE NEVER BEING SO CONFUSED WITH A CHARACTER! Look, Tamlin was a thing, yeah, I liked him but god knows that I had a super crush with Rhysand so I was not having any Tamlin' shit in ACOMAF. And even when Rhys was in his 'Dark Lord' persona in ACOTAR, I WAS THERE FOR IT! -LOL, I always manage to talk about ACOTAR in some way-But then there is Warner, who everyone seems to love and I don't fucking understand. Look, I know how plot twist can work -THANK YOU SJM- but right now I can't imagine a way where Warner is turned as the best male in history. I mean, let's talk about the fact that he used a baby to see Juliette's powers. A BABY! What happened with Jenkins I can try to understand, because I don't know if they -the soldiers- were going to try some shit with Juliette. But with the baby!? THAT WAS SICK!Okay, let's put that aside. Right now, I feel like Warner is obsessed with Juliette. Like, I understand the basis of why he was helping Juliette. I like this whole idea where he says to her that he wants her to feel like an equal, that she doesn't need to feel like an error or that something is wrong with her and he actually treats her like she's never been treated before, like a human being. THAT, is okay. I like when he's all: Embrace yourself, love yourself for what you are.But then he's all, we could be unstoppable together and he kinda lose perspective? Yeah, he's being patience with her but why would she accept him when he's nearly imposing himself over her. The whole ""I want you to want it, to want me"" is creppy. Sometimes I could feel Rhysand behind Warner mask, like when he take her to his room after the whole Jenkins incident.That moment I feel it was the most real moment with Warner in the whole book. He was all like ""I'm such a good liar"" and when Juliette says to him to go to hell he's like ""I'm working on it"" and just for that response I'M HERE TO GIVE WARNER A TRY!Dude, that response was so Rhysand. I can see a martyr when I read it, too! And my theory concludes with Juliette saying ""Your poor mother"" and Warner losing it XD IT WAS SUPER RANDOM AND SUPER REVEALING TO ME!! It was like a shout into the void. -Oh, and Warner TOTALLY HAVE A BRITISH ACCENT!-So, my theory about Warner is that he has something to protect -mostly his mother or some family member- or something to discover -maybe he don't know where his mother is, and wants to help her- and so he becames this dark persona for the sake of whatever secret reason he has.But even when I think Warner have a secret agenda, that doesn't mean he can be all creppy and obsessed with Juliette. Honestly, I don't understand what is going on with him, because he puts Juliette in the position where she is suffering for what she's doing and he still says to her that he loves her! He's nuts!Anyway, I will talk more about Warner later, let's talk about Adam *grins*So, Juliette's touch is lethal. Yeah, now that THAT'S out there, Adam is immune to her touch. Yeah, let that sink for a minute. Now, Adam has this tattoo in his chest, a bird, a bird with a golden crown or something like that. Now you could be asking: What the hell has the bird to do with this shit? And I will tell you, well, my friend, apparently nothing.Because, even when Juliette dreamed about the EXACT same bird, she is not suspicious about the bird tattoo! Just let me say it, NOTHING IS A COINCIDENCE, EVERYTHING HAS A REASON, THE UNIVERSE IS RARELY SO LAZY! *Thank you, Sherlock Holmes*I can't be the only person who is suspicious about the freaking bird -not like the bird is bad or evil or something like that *laughs histerically* but something about Adam-. That bird -the dreams about the bird-has to mean something! Yeah, so cool, Adam representes ""wings"" to Juliette but we need to focus in reality, girl!So, you -Juliette, I'm sorry, I like to adress the characters as if we were speaking XD weird, I know- can kill by just touching a person, EXCEPT for Adam.Okay, so, there is an exception to the rule. The thing is that when there is a exception to something, there tends to be a reason to explain said exception.So, why the hell can Adam touch Juliette?Oh, but that isn't just the big ""surprise"". No, no, no. Warner is also an exception! Look, the only common factor that I can see is the radiation that Adam AND Warner were exposed, to which Juliette is immune, as Adam said. But then, Benji was in that camp too, and he isn't an exception -but maybe Adam and Warner were exposed so many times and not just once, as Benji was- so, I don't know where that left us.My problem is that Juliette seems to not care that there are two exceptions to her rule now. I mean, if Tahereh is going to put me a 'Bella' in here, I need to be warned, LOL! I mean, if in some way, Adam ""power"" is to be a force field, or that he is indeed immune to every power, well, then Warner is too.Whatever, talking about Adam. Dude, your life had been tough, I'm sorry. Taking care of your brother, searching for the girl you were in love since third grade who is also lethal -That's kinda weird and maybe obsessing but who am I to judge?-. Okay, I understand that, but then his relationship with Juliette escalates super quickly!Look, I understand, background story was sweet. I like their connection, Adam been there for Juliette when bullies were on her, but then she says ""I love you"" and goddammit, he never said it back -And maybe is too quickly to say 'I love you' to the guy but since Juliette has never had someone who cared about her I kind of understand that she's going to have an instalove-.Look, there is something off with Adam. First evidence, when he ask Kenji if he had followed him all ALL the time. Like, I know when someone is keeping secrets.Adam is sweet, like, I really like him in this moment. I will not gonna lie, Warner's words about how Adam was using Juliette to escape, hit me. I'm very suspicious about him now, -more now that it just occured to me that maybe Adam was using Juliette to enter the Omega point *suspicious glare*- and I will keep an eye on him.Warner constantly flirting with Juliette was amazing. Good lord, his name could also be Rhysand because he's a shameless flirt.Whatever, let's talk about my fave in the book! KENJI AKA MR. PERSONALITY!!! Kenji was great, he was just there, shining like a diamond and I need more of him in the next book.So, to finish, Juliette isn't my fave. Like, I really think she's naive. She trusted Adam really quickly and I want her to be more. I want her to have a real arc.Warner is a lunatic and I'm intrigued, damn me.Adam is keeping something secret, there is something about him that I'm not seeing it.Also, I finished this book in a night! I can't believe that this book is seriously that short!Like a little parenthesis, the Omega point. They are kinda the X-men to me XDCastle right now is okay, I mean, I'll keep my eyes open with this whole organization."
290,1,"Let me preface this by saying that the following is a partial review. I'm writing this for the parts I have read and I'm also writing this because Rida is waiting for my thoughts on it. I will be very honest in the following paragraphs and it is not my intent to hurt anyone's feelings or anything of that nature. I also want the world to know that I think Tahereh Mafi (what I have gleaned from her online presence) is an awesome person and I wish her all the very best in her future projects.With that said, let's get to the point.I did not like Shatter Me. I didn't like it so much I couldn't finish it. And I bought the book, mind you, sacrificing at least one meal so I could hold it in my hands and be creepy like Gollum with the ring. I know that everyone seems to be besides themselves at the ""gorgeous prose"" and ""strong characters"" in the novel and I feel like we're either reading different books or I am on crack or something because seriously? This is only the third book this year that I have had this reaction to and since I've read about 402 books so it's a rare occurrence.The biggest obstacle I came across in my attempt to read this book was the writing. Yes, the same writing that hundreds are lauding. Okay, to frame my reaction, let me tell you that I write and I have had enough success as a writer that I am confident of my judgements (and my taste) and ability to speak with some authority where the writing is concerned.Mafi's prose is so full of jarring (and contradictory) images that it's difficult to finish a page without stopping at least once with your thoughts reflecting some intensity of ""wtf"" feeling that often fills a person at points of bewilderment and astonishment. One metaphor per sentence is excessive but if you choke that sentence with three or four metaphors...yeah, not cool. Especially if those metaphors are contradictory. On one page she is damning the sun, on the other, she is claiming it to be awesome and then on yet another there's another metaphor attached to the sun that makes for a fractured narrative that is the opposite of being compelling. (I would quote and cite but I don't feel like going through the pain again.)I come from the school of thought that in writing, when you want to make something have more of an effect, you use subtlety. You lead your horse to the river and then leave him alone to figure out where and how to drink. Ya know? Mafi may have written gems, pieces that are compelling but honestly, they are all so buried with fragments that seem to be quivering with melodrama and pathos, that seem contrived that it was all I could do to read as far as I did. It's like reading a book written completely in purple prose. Exhausting and not very enchanting.Let's talk about the characters. I don't know why Juliette is found to be ""strong"" because I found her irritating. And sniveling. I get that your life is horrible but please, woman, get off your high horse and stop being so freaking virtuous. I mean, COME ON, people treat you like shit and you want me to believe that you don't even have the littlest bitterness? You are a victim and you are determined to cling to that role and even your ""strengths"" make you weep because you don't want to be odd. It reads as unreal and not a little Mary-Sue-ish that this supremely beautiful child, (Oh yes, she's so beautiful, her physical beauty comes close to defining her, Warner makes several references to her, so does Adam, so do other boys, why can't she be just normal? Not beautiful, is it necessary for her to be so gorgeous?) who has been treated so horribly (even by her own parents) but she harbors not the littlest wish for vengeance.Yeah. I'm not saying I want to see her turn evil, I just want her to be more realistic. I could barely discern any of her personality with all her pontificating and 1, 2, 3, counting. Let's talk about Adam. Where do I start? Let's see. He's beautiful. And Juliette has loved him forever. I'm not lying. She says that herself. He's her only friend, it's the love that shakes the earth and well yeah, so what? Adam has no personality of his own. He only exists in context to Juliette and wouldn't it be cool if he were a figment of her imagination?And at the end, when she jolts awake, she's still in that stinking cell? No, he's real. They're making out and feeling feelings that make no difference to me because I have no connection to either of them.Warner is supposed to be this powerful dude but when I gave up on the book, he had been easily conquered by the awesome Adam and was saying stuff like ""you're making the greatest mistake of your life..."" where have you heard that before? It reminds me of this awesome villain in Bollywood movies and the hero going ""Main tumhe chorunga nahi!!! Kamine!"" (I won't let you go! Bastard!) Hurhur. Yeah, from purple prose to tired, cliched dialogue.So there you have it. My partial review. One that probably screams my dissatisfaction with the entire novel. I couldn't finish it because I found the plot lacking, the characters not characterized and the writing painful. You might like it better because looking at the reviews, I seem to be one of the very few who feels this way. Now that you know my mind, make up yours.Oh and some excerpts thanks to another reviewer:"
291,1,"1 Star is much more than this book actually deserves. There was not even a single thing that I liked about it, nothing at all . In my opinion, this book should’ve been named Touch Me instead of Shatter Me. For someone whose touch was forbidden, she spent an awful lot of time wanting to get touched.“You can't touch me,"" I whisper. I'm lying, is what I don't tell him. He can touch me, is what I'll never tell him. Please touch me, is what I want to tell him.”See what I mean?!This book is one of those where the author comes up with a bullshit story, has a weak, tortured heroine, handsome hero, smouldering villain and…surprise, surprise How can we forget our dear love triangle?But in this book, the main love story was even creepier in my opinion, creepier than insta-love because the two main characters were in love with each other since Wow, they got their hormones pretty soon, huh?And I don’t really understand Warren’s character. He was the villain but what was his intention? All he wanted to do was destroy the world and create the one he wanted, the one he could rule but - . That was never answered and neither was the reason of him being madly in love with Juliet. He was crazy about her even before he saw her. That is just stupid.Oh God, the horror!Never have I read such overly-pretentious writing. Every sentence was in the form of a phrase which was to sound beautiful but in reality it sounded like a 5-year old attending Creative Writing classes. So, so horrible that I can’t even think of proper words to describe it and if I do start, I will not stop ranting on for pages. I will just mention a few quotes here to prove my point-She kept saying this nonsensical things over and over and again which was super-irritating. And I remember there was page on which ""I am not insane"" was written all over it, and that made her look insane.There was a moment when Juliet said “I am a Venus flytrap”, and I lost it. I had been controlling myself for so long, trying to keep moving forward but that was the limit. I got so sick of Tahereh Mafi's writing at that point, the way her every sentence began and ended with metaphors, similes, alliterations or whatever the fuck that was, it got on my nerves! I was like Your excessive use of made-up shitty metaphors make Cassandra Clare look like a better writer!The one star that I have given are not to this book, but to myself. It is for me for reading this book, till the last page. I can’t believe I read through that disastrous and extremely pointless world building andTowards the end this book turned out to be a sci-fi thriller rather than dystopia. All that mutant shit seemed totally inspired by X-Men. Someone needs to explain the author what a dystopia is, it does not mean writing just any story in a post-apocalyptic/sci-fi world, there are several other aspects to it like a strict society, suppressive rules etc which make it so.I am not going to read its sequel even if Adrian Ivashkov himself will ask me to!"
292,4,"Confieso que no le tenía mucha fe a esta historia, la tenía muy pendiente (desde hace años), pero logró cautivarme 🙌🏻 y ya quiero comenzar con la segunda parte 💕Había leído varías distopias antes y pensé que ya todo lo demás sería similar, pero me equivoqué, la historia es original y demasiado adictiva.Los personajes, me gusto bastante Juliette, la protagonista, su personalidad se adapta a su historia de vida. Con Adam, me pasa algo contradictorio, siento como que la autora ha intentado de hacer que por la fuerza me guste, y no sé como que siempre estoy pensando que oculta algo.Warner, creo que es un buen personaje, me tiene intrigada, peroo me falta más desarrollo, conocer su historia.Pero el que realmente llamó mi atención es Kenji, es que sus diálogos son los mejores, me ha sacado muchas sonrisas, y quiero saber más de este personaje!Así que estoy a la espera de que la segunda entrega me sorprenda, además de poder conocer más a esos personajes que siento que aún están inconclusos, poco definidos. Así que espero leerlo pronto! 🤞🏻🤞🏻"
293,4,2nd Reread: February 2023-Buddy read with Laura ❤️I still don't get why I fell for Adam the first time I read this.------------------------------------------------This book has a special place in my heart because I think that it was the one that made me read so many books in English (which is not my mother tongue).I'm over the I-only-read-dystopian-books phase now but if there's one author that can make me go back to this genre that's . I absolutely love her writing style and I love her characters so much.
294,5,"Shatter Me by Tahereh MafiTells the story of Juliette, if she touches someone they die. She is dragged into Warner, leader of an army and very attractives world. She hates him as he offers her a future she can't take. As her time increases in the company of Adam, a boy she has loved forever. She must fight for what's right.CHARACTERS-When I first read this 2 years ago, I loved Warner. He was just so fun and intriguing and I really comapred him to the darkling which I love the darkling. He was just such a complex character to get to know.ROMANCE-PLOT-The plot wasn't very unique but it definitely was entertaining.ENDING-Such a great ending!Charcaters-10/10Romance-10/10Plot-9/10Ending-10/10"
295,4,"Beautifully written with lyrical and poetic phrases. It is so effortless and just flows like a river. The story itself is very interesting too. Once you get into it, its super fast paced. I finished it in matter of hours.Juliette is certainly not a stable character and her struggle is portrayed marvelously. Throughout the novel we see her cope and grow. The 'crossouts' show how disturbed or scared or tortured she is.Adam. I like him. He's sweet. He has suffered too and has his own battles to fight.Warner. Okay, so is it weird if I say I'm kinda intrigued by him? I mean the guy is kinda crazy and obsessed but some tiny part of me likes him??Kenji. Yes! Funny sidekick? Yes! I love this dude.Now I know what everyone means when they say Tahereh Mafi has a way with writing. It's a bit soothing to read. Some phrases were a bit much but still alluring."
296,3,"I didn't hate this, but I didn't love it? Juliette was an okay main character, I still love Kenji, and Warner is pretty fucked up but interesting. if Adam Kent did not exist this would be 4 stars.-------------------middle school emma thought this book was the shit and I do NOT trust her !!!I'm livetweeting this reread and lowkey already trashing it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
297,4,"Nota final: 4.5/5⭐️⭐️⭐️. Hasta que terminé de leerlo!!! Qué enganche, por Dios, si lo empecé a leer ayer y son más de 300 páginas!!! Rara vez me sucede. Como distopía aún tiene mucho por mejorar, pero realmente espero que se deba a que es inicio de saga. No puedo criticarle mucho a la autora, su pluma es muy delicada, impecable. El ritmo es brutal, se lee prácticamente sólo. Tengo que empezar Unravel Me ya mismo. ❤️"
298,2,"⭐2 stars⭐""Aw, you trust me?""""As long as I have a clear shot.""Juliette was the worst part of this book for me.. The romance was a close second..I really hope it gets better in the next books."
299,4,"This was an enjoyable and quick read.I really hope the rest of the series is more eventful than this book. I feel this book lacked a lot of the action and was more building up the story. Please tell me if the rest of the series is not like this?I do plan on reading the sequel, I kinda want to know what happens next with Juliette."
300,5,Juliette was SO relatable there’s that and there is Warner and kenji… so yeah. I need more of them. Even though Warner sounded like a Maniac.ALSO everyone excuse me for my review that never comes I’m so bad at it.
301,3,"Five stars for the writing, but two stars for the plot."
302,5,Kenji Kishimoto supremacy. That's it. That's the review.(Reread)
303,4,i mean this was such an easy and fun read!!! can’t wait to read the next ones💃💃💃
304,4,Is it bad that I'm already in love with Warner?
305,5,"omgg I'm so excited to read the next one!! and omg I love Kenji hes definitely my favorite, not for Juliette tho I just like him cuz he's funny. Im just waiting for the part I get to like warner tho"

307,1,"Книга първа ""Разбий ме"":В ""Разбий ме"" няма смисъл. Достатъчно е да прочетете всяко второ изречение и ще се убедите в това. Да не говорим за повтарящите се ""и тогава"", ""изчервявам се"" и ""устните му"". Опитах се да се самоубедя, че това е интересен литературен похват, но очевидно не съм достатъчно добра в самозаблудата. Изреченията са третирани, сякаш са увредени. Веднага давам примери:(чакай, какво?)(това звучи като сцена от Saw.)(ииууу...)(не. Просто не.)(какво се случва тук, по дяволите?)(признавам, че нищо не схванах. Но се радвам, че трябваше да прочета толкова думи за тази безполезна информация.)""[Очите му са](о, моля ти се!)(да, разбрах вече.)(започвам да агонизирам)(WTF?!)(много забавен клиничен език.)(айрол. Огромен айрол.)(по дяволите, не можеш ли да пишеш като нормално човешко същество, мацко?)(OMG)(добре, толкова ли не можеше да го съкратиш до ""Джеймс си дълбоко""? Повтарянето на ""дълбоко"" три пъти не го прави по-заспал.)(много оригинално, наистина. Имам предвид, че съм сигурна, че няма да попадна никога вече на подобно описание в друга книга.)(мозъкът ми! Мозъкът ми! Неееее...)(ПРЕСТАНИ! ПРОСТО ПРЕСТАНИ!)Нужно ли е да обяснявам колко е тъпо това? Всичко е пренаситено с излишни, абсолютно безсмислени метафори �� абсурдни тъпотии.*тук почива Ивз Андонова, поразена от дъждовните капки*Да преведем какво се е опитала да каже авторката: ""Валеше"".Историята? Каква история? Първо, това не е дистопия (Джордж Оруел сигурно се обръща в гроба си), а пародия с романтични лигавщини. Телетъбис са по дистопични от тази книга. Ако е имало история, то тя се е удавила сред морето от свръхентусиазъм, сълзливи словоизлияния и абсурден опит да се комбинират X-Men, Дивергентите и лоша любовна поезия, написана от тринайсет годишен. Няма сюжет зад цялото целуване и неговите устни, неговите устни, неговите устни, неговите устни, неговите устни и топчетата памук, които необяснимо са задръстили трахеята на героинята, вероятно в напразен опит да спрат монолозите ѝ. Героите са свръх заети с размяната на слюнка през цялото време. Споменах ли, че Джулиет е най-тъпия герой, който съм засичала в YA досега? Не? Да? Не? Е, сега го споменавам. През цялото време исках да ѝ разбия главата с бейзболна бухалка.Нашата специална героиня изпитва съжаление към себе си. Пак.Нека повторя:Изпитва съжаление към себе си. Пак.Изпитва съжаление към себе си. Пак.Изпитва съжаление към себе си. Пак.Тази книга е по-лоша от предишната. Може би нямаше да е толкова зле ако Техере Мафи беше престанала да се опитва.Скапаният любовният триъгълник ме кара да плача със сълзи, солени като туршия, преседяла до синьото усещане на средата на лятото. Те се спускат по островите на лицето ми, залепвайки розовите листенца на отчаянието в пещерите на синусите ми и увисват на Евереста на носа ми. После политат като картонени изрезки в локва. Мразя гравитацията, тя е безчувствена като оранжев морков, захвърлен в свинска копанка. Чувам как крещят неистово като безчет пухкави леминги, докато падат в бездната, удавяйки се във вълните на мъката, обгръщаща моето съществуване.Кап.Кап.Кап.Много исках Джулиет в края на краищата да се изчука и с Адам, и с Уорнър, след това ги зареже, и да избяга. Щеше да е страхотно. Разбира се, не стана така.Не бих могла да го кажа по-добре. Това всъщност е тази книга. Тоест и трите книги. И тъй като съм съгласна с господин Дарвин, че само най-приспособените ще оцелеят, и прочетох цялата трилогия, мога гордо да изпъча гърди и да се наградя с тиквен медал."
308,4,"Before we go any further, I just need to get something out of the way.Wynne needs more Warner.There is not enough Warner in this book.Wynne demands more Warner in the next book or Wynne will start a riotOkay. Now that we get that out of the way, I only have another thing to say.This is my second time reading this book, and although I have picked up some flaws that I did not realize when I first read it, I still really enjoyed reading it. The book still captured my attention wholly from start to finish like it did the first time, and let me just say, not a lot of books manage to do that.Even though I am happy that I still love this book the same after all these years, I did also realize that Tahereh has a very unique way of writing her book. It seems like she has this habit of using hyperbole, so much so that she sometimes over-uses it and it just ended up being weird. Not to mention her liking of using flowery words to describe what her characters are feeling. Most of the time it works, but those times when it doesn't, it just ends up being really weird and awkward.I don't know if I am the weird one here, but when I read a character's thoughts, I imagine it literally happening unless stated otherwise. So you can imagine my confusion when I read .Or this :I have to re-read it three time to make sense that her eyes weren't literally shattering. There are a lot of instances where Tahereh uses more of this flowery and overly hyperbole proses that makes me just have to stop and figure out what she is trying to convey. But other than that, I have no complaints because I fucking loved this book.Cause of who? Warner. Warner is the answer to everything and Warner makes my world goes round."
309,4,"I think the easiest way to sum up my feelings about this book is just to say:Love the story, the plot, and most of the characters. However, the only problem lies in the fact that I cannot stand the romance in this book.This book was super addicting and a great read, and I'm definitely looking forward to reading more of the series while secretly hoping that Adam dies or something.Is it common for people to not like Adam?? He's the love interest book and besides his one redeeming quality of being a good older brother he literally has zero personality. Insta-love doesn't usually bother me too much if the characters end up having good chemistry but with Adam and Juliette I found myself constantly making this face because the dialogue was just that cringey:on the flip side I did really like most of the characters besides Adam. For example, Juliette has a very unique voice as the narrator and I really did like her as a person.Also Warner. Warner.He's actually an interesting character. I'm excited to see where the story goes regarding him.Unfortunately for me, my favorite characters of the book though were either more minor, or were only included in the later parts of the book. These characters are James and Kenji.James is just so funny, and he provides so much comic relief to every situation. He also provides Adam with his only good quality.Kenji is also hilarious, and I love his personality. I honestly kind of wish he was the love interest in this book instead of Adam because I just cannot stand Adam.Also, at the end of the book we are introduced to a character named Castle who seems pretty interesting.Overall, this was a super fun and fast-paced read, and I'm excited for the rest of the books in the series! (Secretly hoping they get rid of Adam somehow lol)“I only know now that the scientists are wrong.The world is flat.I know because I was tossed right off the edge and I've been trying to hold on for 17 years. I've been trying to climb back up for 17 years but it's nearly impossible to beat gravity when no one is willing to give you a hand.” - Tahereh Mafi (Shatter Me)"

On TikTok, Gr and insta.Listen, I can understand you, when you say that you love the shatter me series, but for me it’s a big no. It’s always about Aaron mf Warner. He is a creep. A killer, a psychopath and just interested in violence. Just bc he will say lyhfml, doesn’t mean that he’s the number one bookboyfriend.Everything I can remember about that book is that Adam has deep, deep, sparkling, blue eyes. And that’s it. Juliette talked more about gazes and eyes than I about books.“𝑴𝒚 𝒍𝒊𝒇𝒆 𝒊𝒔 𝒇𝒐𝒖𝒓 𝒘𝒂𝒍𝒍𝒔 𝒐𝒇 𝒎𝒊𝒔𝒔𝒆𝒅 𝒐𝒑𝒑𝒐𝒓𝒕𝒖𝒏𝒊𝒕𝒊𝒆𝒔 𝒑𝒐𝒖𝒓𝒆𝒅 𝒊𝒏 𝒄𝒐𝒏𝒄𝒓𝒆𝒕𝒆 𝒎𝒐𝒍𝒅𝒔.”Even Juliette was a boring main character. At first I thought, damn she can kill with her touch? Then I read the book and ngl everything she did was bitching and complaining. Like stfu.I thought, damn badass queen but that’s everything I got.And we don’t talk about the lack of the world building, but let me tell you this. It is bad. Very bad.Look, I don’t like bad romance books. But what I hate are bad dystopian book. I mean, yeah I can understand when you can’t write a good dystopian book anymore, when there’s Divergent, Maze runner and the hunger games. But it was always about Adam, Juliette and Warner.And that, ladies and gentlemen, was a really bad combination. One of the worst love triangles. Cuz, I hate everything single character. They’re were so flat and don’t have any character development. The fact that I clearly know that Juliette will choose Aaron was so clear after the first 50 pages. And also I would know it after tiktok and the spoilers. It is just soooo obvious, it sucks.And I know guys. U will say, its gets better trust me. But, girlll, a book series with a bad first book is for me already a no. Why tf it has to be one book long, so I can finally start like Aaron Warner and Juliette??So, two stars. One because I think that every author deserves a star and the other one because the book is not to long. Thank you."
311,3,"This book was alright, but not really a genre that appeals to me much. There are very few paranormal/science fiction/fantasy-type of books that I get into. I guess it just isn't my thing, but if you love this genre, you might enjoy it immensely.The writing style was definitely unique. I've never read anything quite like this and it threw me for a loop at first. Once I got used to the repetition and strike throughs, I was able to get into the story more. I'm still not certain what to make of it all though.The story is set in a futuristic dystopia, following the near total destruction of Earth's ecosystem and subsequent break-down of society. Needless to say, the backdrop is pretty dreary.Shunned, ridiculed and later locked in an asylum for years because of her deadly supernatural abilities, Juliette is starved for human contact. When she gets an unexpected roommate, she thinks she's finally found someone that cares for her. She quickly finds out that her new roommate, Adam, isn't what he appears to be.With Adam, the kind-hearted boy she now remembers from her youth, and an obsessed evil tyrant both vying for her affections, she is thrown into a sea of confusion and turmoil. She has to figure out who to trust, and quick, as others want to use her abilities to further their own cause, attempting to turn her into the evil monster that she's always been portrayed as.The first book in the series, 'Shatter Me' leaves us wondering where the story will go. I don't know if I'll continue the series, mainly because I'm not really drawn to books in this genre. I thought I'd give it a shot because id heard so many positive things about this book. Now I have and can say with conviction that it isn't for me. I can see the appeal, so if you're a lover of paranormal or dystopian stories, you'd probably enjoy it."
312,1,"Este libro no me ha gustado nada, de hecho entra en mi lista de los peores libros que he leido en mi vida.Ambientado en un mundo postapocalíptico, donde el hambre, la desesperación y la muerte están a la orden del día, y donde impera un nuevo régimen El Restablecimiento que se han aprovechado de la situación y donde también hay unos pocos rebeldes que se oponen a este régimen.Nuestra protagonista es Juliette una joven de 17 años, que ha estado en diversos manicomios desde los 14 años, ella es una chica bastante especial tiene un don/maldición, hace daño a la gente al tocarla, por eso El Restablecimiento, la quiere usar como arma contra los rebeldes.No me han convencido nada ni la relación de Juliette con Adam, ni la relación-obsesión de Warner con Juliette, poco creíbles.La novela se me ha hecho lenta, y tremendamente aburrida, ninguno de los protagonistas me ha gustado y la que menos Juliette, me ha parecido muy tonta. La narración parece ser que quiere ser poética y de lo más cursi y empalagosa. Lo único bueno es que tiene los capítulos cortos y se avanza más rápido.Además me ha resultado muy molesto que la protagonista repitiese bastante a menudo y varias veces frases completas como si tuviera TOC y que la autora a lo largo de toda la novela haya decidido tachar diversas frases, y no he llegado a comprender el motivo por el cuál lo ha hecho.He leido en otras reseñas que hacia el final se hace más interesante, yo no lo he notado, igual es porque ya estaba deseando terminar la novela que seme estaba haciendo eterna."
313,3,"This book is about two horny teenagers a girl named Juliette, who can kill people just by touching them. She's never really known love or affection from anyone, because she's always been a ""freak"" with murderous powers. On top of that, she's been imprisoned under terrible conditions for a few years, but everything's about the change as soon as she gets a cell mate, the mysterious Adam.They hit it off quickly and basically want to get jiggy with it immediately and together they escape the evil, evil, evil Warner who's after Juliette for her gift .OK, the thing is - I expected to hate this, but I didn't. I also didn't particularly love it. There's something off about the writing style, but I blame it on the fact that it's a book from 2011 and it was probably cool back then to repeat a word or a sentence there times, all the time, all the time, all the time. Or to use really weird metaphors?! One I scribbled down on a piece of paper went something like ""when I see him, my heart is parasailing in the spring"". I don't get this thing where authors use weird expressions to say something really simple. It doesn't make their writing better in my opinion, only a bit weird. There were many, worse ones I could have used as examples, I just didn't realise to write them down.Had I read this back when it came out, I might have enjoyed it much more. But 2022 me is just meh. I might try reading some of the next books in the series at some point, we'll see."
314,3,"Rating: 3/5, Spice: 1/5 Juliette is a 17 year with a lethal touch. As these things happen in YA books, the only two known people that can touch her are two very handsome men around her age that both also happen to be in love with her.These two love interests are Adam and Warner. I have no idea what Juliette sees in the personality void that is Adam. He is so boring. His one good quality is that he doesn't die when Juliette touches him. Then there's Warner. HE has potential. HE is interesting. There's more to him.With that said, I'm calling it now. Warner is the end game love interest. There are some clues in the book that Warner and Juliette will be enemies to lovers. Juliette's writing shows she's clearly attracted to him () Also, Warner says which I think is significant."
315,2,"2.75 ⭐️ this book just did not do it for me... i felt like there was nothing happening the entire time. i really expected to love this, but i just could not get into it for some reason. it could be because i am coming out of a romance binge. the ending was definitely entertaining and captivating, i feel like it made up for a lot of the misses during the beginning + middle of the novel. i fully understand the writing style is supposed to mimic juliette's mind, but i found it a bit frustrating especially with the poor grammar and lack of punctuation. i know it's me being picky and it shouldn't take away from the actual plot of the book, it just frustrated me at times. overall, this book was good enough for me to possibly consider continuing the series. i just do not believe it lived up to the hype :("
316,5,"This book was absolutely amazing ! I could not put this book down at all ! Out of all the first books to trilogies, Shatter Me has to be my favorite. It's amazing that I'm about to say this but I kind of liked it better than Divergent and the Divergent series is one of my favorite. Shatter me has a great plot, incredible characters, and a lot more. If you have not read this book... WHAT ARE YOU DOING ?! Go straight to you're nearest book store and pick this book up ! You will not be disappointed"

(البته تاحدی دارم چرت می‌گم. عاشق شخصیت‌هام😂😍 منتها چون جلد اوله و معلومه به مرور بهتر می‌شه سعی می‌کنم ریزبین باشم /:)شخصیت جولیت، ساده‌ست. مثل همه‌شون! نمی‌دونم چرا مدام داشتم با آدلینا (ارجاع به برگزیدگان جوان) مقایسه‌اش می‌کردم. شاید چون توی یه بُعد از شرایط قرار داشتن( با همون انزوا و طردشدگی‌ها و شکست‌ها).اما جولیت برخلاف آدلینا، نسبت به شرایطش توی ثبا�� احساسی و عقلی قرار ��اره. و این کمی غیرمنطقیه😉چرا؟چون جولیت طرد‌شده بود، همه اون رو به وحشیانه‌ترین شکل ممکن شکسته بودن، و اتفاقاتی رو از سر گذرونده بود که می‌طلبید احساسات منفی و حس کینه‌توزی و انتقامش رو تقویت کنه، می‌طلبید کمی شخصیت سایکوتیک‌تری داشته باشه یا عکس‌العمل‌های نشون بده که آشفتگی درونی و روانی‌‌اش رو بهتر به نمایش بذاره، اما جولیت هنوز همون کرکتر انسان‌دوست و کیوت و مهربون باقی موند که می‌خواد ""زیبایی‌""های دنیایی که طردش کرد رو باور کنه. نمی‌دونم شاید من طبق قانونِ «هر کنشی، یه واکنشی داره»، انتظار داشتم جولیت کمی شکسته‌تر، ویرانگرتر و انتقام‌جوتر باشه😬نه این‌که اینطوری خوبه‌ها، فقط چون سیر و روند طبیعیِ شخصیت یه آدمه اینو می‌گم. خود من هم جاش بودم این‌طوری می‌بودم. به‌هرحال من جولیت رو علارغم همه‌چی، دوست داشتم و به‌نظرم به مرور، قراره نویسنده ازش یه کرکتر بهتر بسازه😍آدام😢اصلا از اولشم لعنتی و مهربون بودی (:شخصیت آدام خطی و ساده بود. تحت‌تأثیر چیزی نبود. نه خشمی، نه کینه‌ای، و این نه بد بود نه خوب... من دوست دارم باور کنم کسایی هستن که بخاطر دارایی‌هاشون (مثل آدام که جیمز رو داشت) می‌جنگن و براشون مهم نيست چه پیشینه‌ی نحسی داشتن. البته من از آدام همون انتظاراتی رو داشتم که از جولیت! منتها با شدت کمتر... به‌نظر میاد زندگیش با پدرش باید تاثیرات ماندگار و منفی‌ای گذاشته باشه که خب... فعلا توی آدام دیده نمی‌شه. منتظرم نمود کنه و همه خشمشون رو مثل آتیش زیر خاکستر بروز بدن! چون فکر می‌کنم این تنها چیزیه که می‌تونه ادای دین کنه به سوژه‌ی داستان👌نمی‌دونم چطور بگم، با این‌که آدام رو دوسش داشتم و به‌نظرم اون شخصیت قهرمانانه‌ای که از خودش نشون داد قشنگ بود، ولی عمیقاً احساس بدی دارم. چون حس می‌کنم همه‌چی مثل آرامش قبل طوفانه. قراره چی به سر پسرم بیاد نمی‌دونم! و این‌که تازه من یه جلد خودم و دارم این‌طوری می‌گم. جلدای بعدی رو که خوندم، قطعا به چیزی که الان نوشتم می‌خندم😁وارنر... پسره‌ی بی‌رحمِ چند‌شخصیتیِ جذاب خونسرد😅من اصلا نمی‌فهمم تو چرا باید این‌قدر آسیب‌زا باشی؟من فکر نمی‌کنم وارنر ویلن اصلی داستان باشه. و راستش با توجه به اون فضایی که نویسنده برای نقش‌آفرینی وارنر انتخاب کرد، منتظر یه تغییر و تحول بزرگ توی مسیر حرکت شخصیت‌ها از جمله وارنر هستم. و همچنین نسبت به تیپ شخصیتی‌ای که نویسنده براش در نظر گرفته؛ گیجم! نمی‌دونم باید چه احساسی نسبت بهش داشته باشم یا چجوری قضاوتش کنم. اما حقیقت اینه که چندان باهاش ارتباط نگرفتم، شاید چون هنوز جلد اوله و شخصیت‌ها فرصت کافی برای خودنمایی نداشتن، شاید چون حضورش کمرنگ‌تر از بقیه بوده و نویسنده بیشتر وقتشو برای سازماندهی جولیت گذاشته، و شاید هم بخاطر اینه که قصد و غرض وارنر مشخص نیست واسم (:به هرحال من به آینده‌ی این شخصیت خیلی امیدوارم و به‌نظرم پتانسیل اینو داره که خودش رو به طرز جذاب و ماهرانه‌ای نشون بده؛ همونطوری که از خصوصیاتش برمیاد، وارنر می‌تونه کرکتر ویرانگر و آسیب‌زایی باشه، و از این بابت خوشحالم که فعلا قهرمان نیست😏. همچنین من از مصونیتش نسبت به جولیت احساس خوبی ندارم. یعنی چی می‌شه؟ 💔و... کِنجی!کنجی!کنجی!این بچه رو کادوپیچ کنین من ببرمش. امیدوارم همونطوری که توی ذهنمه، ارتباطش با بقیه سرجاش بمونه.😢 اولین حضورش توی یک‌سوم آخری کتاب بود، اما وای تقریبا می‌تونم بگم اولین باره که اصلی‌ها رو ول کردم چسبیدم به یه فرعی جذاب و بامزه و وحشتناک خـر ...😁❤️درموردش همین بس که وقتی دیدم اونم ریگی به کفشش داره بیشتر ازش خوشم اومد /:خب دیگه طولانی نکنم، و شما رو با زیبایی‌های پسرم کنجی تنها می‌ذارم😍😍 راستی فهمیدین اون دیالوگ کی بود؟😉"
322,4,"i liked this more than i expected to, considering all the flack this first book gets. it's definitely early 2010s dystopia vibes, but that's what was in at the time.the first couple chapters are jarring and remind me of the book Speak, but once you get past the almost abstract stream of consciousness, things pick up and get intriguing.villain warner is low key hot.kenji is hilarious.adam is nice, but everyone hates him so i'm gonna assume he's basically gale/dain lol.if i can expect the books only to get better from here, then i'm excited to continue the series.side note: wtf was with that winston guy saying ""Kishimoto"" is a hard last time to pronounce? the caucasity."
323,5,"After I turned the last page of Shatter Me, I set the book down. And then picked it back up, flipped through the pages, and reread several scenes. Then put it down again. Then picked up up again, and the process repeated for quite some time.This book blew my mind.There is a lot of hype around Shatter Me, and I can honestly say that it will not let you down one bit. One of the things that most of the reviews talk about it Tahereh's writing style, which was so absolutely gorgeous. So lyrical, poetic, rich and vivid. The story is told form Juliette's perspective, and she isn't exactly in her right mind after being locked up for so long. Just as the title suggests, she's shattered and trying to hold all the little pieces together. Tahereh's writing style was the perfect medium for conveying Juliette's brokenness. Tahereh didn't need to tell us, we just know by the way Juliette's sees the world.And the characters! They honestly had to be some of the most dynamic and complex characters I've ever read about. Every single one of them had layers of layers of personality and hidden emotion that just when I would start to form an opinion on one of them, they would do something to completely change my mindset. Even Warner, who is the novel's antagonist--and who I personally believe is certifiably insane--had such a depth to him that I had to wonder if he was really as bad as he seemed.But, the true love of the story is of course, Adam. He's sweet and protective. Every single moment that he and Juliette were together was so charged with the chemistry between them that I have to admit a few times I was more than a bit breathless just reading it. Anyone who wants some steamy, so-good-you'll-curl-your-toes kissing scenes, Shatter Me is most definitely your book.The world it's set in doesn't seem to be too far off from our own. It seems to be a dying and decaying version of ours, and Tahereh described it in such clarity that I was right there the whole time I was reading. I can't say enough just how amazing Shatter Me was, and I recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone and everyone.I give Shatter Me 4.5 Stars"
324,2,"So Juliette's touch can kill, she has been held captive for years and now she's out but the person who got her out wants to use her for bad things...but Adam won't let it.Let me start with the praise which is that I loved the cover and the story outline which seemed like the main character is going to make a stance, she will be powerful and fierce, but that wasn't quite it in this first book.I did also like the unique idea of crossed out sentences to represent Juliette's mental state and repetition of words but these got quickly a little tiresome for my liking.What I can say is that I expected more of this great preamble of a synopsis and the ending didn't drag me out to buy the next book in the series... although from the middle of the book to the end, the actions and descriptions got a lot better, I must say.A quick and easy read."
325,4,"4.5⭐️ ok this book is good. like good. it got me hooked ngl. and WARNER. SJDBFJFHFJFJ. HE CAN JUST STRAIGHT CAPTURE ME AND DO EVERYTHING HE WANTS WITH ME. PERIOD. i also heard that Adam is not going to be good guy anymore in the next book, but for now he seems like a good guy. i like him. a little. ok now brb i’m gonna go read the whole entire series"
326,5,I freaking love this book so much Warner is bae and i love him more than any other male character yes my obsession is that serious i just love warner soooo much he’s my everything i can’t wait to reread the other two and finally read the 4th book in March 💕😍💕😍💕😍💕😍💕😍
327,3,"I has such high hopes for this book, that in the end I was a bit disappointed. The characters are amazingly written, but the plot seemed to drag on at times. Overall 2.5/5 stars; I hope the next book gets better!"
328,4,"The writing was incredible and once I got into it I couldn't stop reading, however, I didn't really love the characters they fell a bit flat for me."
329,4,"I liked, I didn't love."
